         "I am Mexican, and I can tell you that this movie is an awful representation of the narcotics problem in Mexico. While the story initially seemed interesting, it quickly became ridiculous. The main premise of the film is that a cruel assassin drug lord becomes a martyr after losing his penis. Additionally, Selenas acting is subpar; she cant even speak Spanish well, despite being cast as a Mexican character. None of the main actors are Mexican, and their Spanish accents come from Spain and the Caribbean, and frankly incomprehensible in Selenas case.Overall, a good idea turned into a bad movie.",

         "Emilia Pérez has sparked significant controversy, and for good reason. From the outset, the lack of Mexican representation like a glaring oversight. The French directors admission that he didnt feel the need to research Mexico, paired with the casting directors claim that no talented Mexican actors could be found, only adds insult to injury. These choices reflect a tone-deaf and dismissive approach to authenticity.Whats even more baffling is how Emilia Pérez managed to garner so many Oscar nominations. While the Academy has a history of nominating films with problematic undertones , those at least offered stories that entertained broad audiences. Emilia Pérez, however, doesnt even accomplish that. The story is dull and lifeless, so much so that out of three of us who watched it, two fell asleep, and the third decided to switch to another movie.To make matters worse, Emilia Pérez is a musical - but not in a good way. The songs are forgettable at best and cringe-worthy at worst, and most of the cast can barely sing. The musical numbers, which should have been a highlight, drag the movie down even further.That said, there are a couple of redeeming elements. Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón deliver strong performances and truly dont deserve the backlash tied to the films broader issues. Their nominations are the only ones that feel genuinely earned. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a mess.Overall, Emilia Pérez is an underwhelming, uninspired production that fails to justify the attention its received.",

         "Emilia Perez isnt a bad movie, but it felt somewhat flat. At times, the story seemed too easy for the characters, lacking tension or conflict. Emilia, in particular, transforms into an overwhelmingly positive character, even though we know from the backstory that she wasnt always so good.The movie tackles a wide range of themes but struggles to fully explore them. Instead of diving deeply into any one idea, it spreads itself too thin, leaving several threads underdeveloped.As someone who doesnt typically enjoy musicals, this film didnt change my mind. However, I can appreciate that this was the directors vision, and I know many viewers will enjoy the musical elements. To its credit, some of the musical numbers were well done, especially those performed by Zoe Saldana. Her performance was a standout and arguably the films biggest revelation, elevating many scenes with her presence and talent.Overall, Emilia Perez is an enjoyable film. While I dont quite understand its acclaim at Cannes, it has its moments.",

Its not a Razzie film by any stretch, but its practically incoherent narrative flow, at times excruciating dialog and lack of internal logic leave it as a mediocre straight-to Netflix commoner in the movie space. Ill give you an example of its bad script, in the movie the characther says Bienvenido which means Welcome, but in the context of the conversation she means to say Your Welcome, De nada in Spanish. It seems they did the writing in French and use google for translation. Yes, it covers some important themes and issues, but that doesnt make your movie good. You still have to build a fundamentally good film around the issues or its just noise. And thats Emilia Perez... just noise.",

Zoe Saldana delivers a strong performance, but the rest of the cast is just average.The film tries to mix crime, drama, and musical elements, but the execution is uneven. Some scenes drag, making the pacing feel sluggish, and the emotional moments often seem forced rather than genuine.

         "Hard to watch",
         "Emilia Pérez is a musical that has sparked debate due to its themes and execution, particularly in Mexico, where its release has been surrounded by controversy. I watched it with an open mind, aware of its narrative, focus, and genre. However, I came away with mixed feelings, which I will break down into three key points: stereotypes, performances, and the script along with the songs.1. Stereotypes: Its impossible to discuss this movie without addressing its cultural treatment. From the very beginning, it feels more like a collection of clichés about Mexico than a genuine exploration of its culture. As a Mexican, Im not offended by stereotypes per se, but here, there seems to be no interest in delving deeper. It feels like a brainstorm of references-sombreros, skulls, and tequila-without adding anything meaningful to the narrative. This lack of authenticity turns the setting into a caricature. The production could have set the story in any other country, swapped these clichés for others, and it wouldnt have made much difference to the plot.2. Performances: Its interesting that the performances have been nominated for multiple awards. However, as a Spanish speaker, the accent and diction were constant distractions. The actresses seem to be trying hard, but the result fails to convey genuine emotions or connect with the audience. A crucial part of acting is mastering dialogue delivery, intonation, and how these elements evoke empathy or rejection toward the characters. This doesnt happen here. No character made me feel their story-I didnt suffer with them or celebrate their victories.3. Script and songs: The script, unfortunately, is one of the films weakest points. The dialogues feel as though they were mechanically translated into Spanish, riddled with errors in conjugation and awkward phrases. This extends to the songs, which fail to work as either music or narrative tools. In a good musical, the songs should integrate organically and move the story forward, but here, they feel forced, as if they were shoehorned into a pre-existing structure without concern for rhythm or coherence.4. The theme: The film touches on a sensitive nerve for Mexicans. Its complicated to humanize drug cartels in a country that suffers the direct consequences of violence, disappearances, and daily fear. The idea of portraying a drug lord as someone deserving of redemption, who wishes to transition to stay true to their identity and even becomes a benefactor of social causes, can feel insulting. For a foreign audience, it might be an interesting narrative, but for those living in the reality of drug-related violence, this idealization borders on indifference toward collective suffering.In conclusion, Emilia Pérez has some interesting technical elements and isolated moments worth noting, but as a whole, its not an enjoyable film. The lack of authenticity in its cultural representation, performances that fail to connect, and a weak script weigh it down too much. That said, cinema is subjective, and if this movie finds its audience, good for it. But for me, rather than being a captivating musical, it was a frustrating experience.",

It is also a film that manages to fascinate and captivate for its whole, long running time.However, there are two major problems: First: the film is ridiculously moralistic.Second: it is absurd to believe that nobody would immediately question the identity and therefore the background of the main character. Her motivation is legit, she wants to make amends, but it is mindboggling that the filmmakers apparently thought it could go unquestioned when the protagonist, a mysterious woman in every respect, carelessly decides to enter the spotlight.",

She was a cartel leader, did lots of bad stuff and at the end also did bad stuff forcing his children to stay with him without explaining anything to his wife! I feel bad for the kids. Their father ruined the whole family by running after his personal gains only. He never thought of anyone else but himself.And why is Rita always with them? I mean does she have no family or close ones? Rita and Emilia did lots of illegal stuff to get rich and the film tried to justify it by sentiment and emotion.

The movie does get ambitious with the blending of genre thrown into the mix and I appreciate that. The performances from Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofia Gascon are very good.

And finally, I thought that the movie did a great job at telling its transgender story.Mixed for Emilia Perez : While the movie is certainly ambitious with its blending of genres, there are elements to this that felt out of place in this movie. The musical numbers feel like they just came out of nowhere and it felt jarring at times.Negatives for Emilia Perez : The movie is way too long and I feel that this movie couldve told its story with a shorter runtime. The movie lost my interest almost immediately and it just became background noise for me.Overall, I admired the filmmakers and actors for being ambitious with this movie, it just fully worked for me.

Saldaña in particular is a revelation.Of writer-director Jacques Audiards previous films, Ive seen four , each memorable in their different ways. None of them prepared me for this one, so hats of to him for not getting stuck in a genre rut.Theres a lot of story and a lot of singing in Emilia Pérez. When the singing is paired with Damien Jalets incisive choreography, the effect is thrilling. Otherwise, the songs drag the movie down. They are musical-theatre lite, dont dig deep, so are not up to the dramatic demands put upon them. Theyre at their best in the rap-inclined numbers, where rhythm is the most important element.The moral of Emilia Pérez seems to be that we can never slough off the past, change who we are or what we want.

         "A musical about a cartel leader undergoing a transition into a female social activist was not on my Oscars bingo card. I am a bit confused on how it snagged a leading 13 Oscar nominations. I really wanted to like it but it felt all over the place, the story felt off somehow... not satisfying i suppose. The movie being a musical seemed really random and the songs were not that great. I dont want to be super negative because it did have some good moments with the acting, costumes/makeup, and some of the choreography. Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofia Gascón put on a great performance and I think that they are deserving of some recognition but I still cant get over the 13 nominations.",

         "Only money is capable of making someone consider this film a good representation of history, culture or anything, on its own or considering the Mexican context. The number of nominations and awards only demonstrates this, that the outpouring of money moves the vote. The Mexican majority itself finds the film disrespectful. A French director who thinks he knows enough about Mexican culture, an international cast with a Mexican actress who isnt even being considered in the awards campaign. Its simply bizarre and frightening that the film industry and academia genuinely consider this work.",

         "Came to write this after seeing its gala screening at the London film festival.A wild, insane roller coaster of a film that mixes crime, comedy, musical and thriller all into one and succeeds with flying colours!The four actresses at the core are the strength and they were directed to perfection by Audiard.Karla plays her character pre transition and post as it comes to her naturally, having underdone it publicly as an actor. Its a powerhouse performance that is so of our time. Im proud to be alive in a time when a trans actress plays a trans role. And not only that, she nails it. The tragedy of leaving a life but the promise of the one shes always needed.Zoe gets to sing, dance, cry and laugh and everything which I think an actor dreams of doing, let alone in one film. I had never seen a film of hers before and I am so happy this was my first because she shines! Theres a scene of her in a car, where realising what has just transpired, she breaks down in hysteria. Think Margo in I, Tonya or Glenn in Dangerous Liasons. That scene alone should win her an Academy award. And she has a beautiful voice!Selena, for whom I was most excited to see this film, kicks it out of the ballpark. Playing a mob wife, that icy, storm-simmering-below-the-surface kind of woman which she needs to revisit IMO because as a young girl who endured intense scrutiny and then went through a psychosis, she knows it too well whats it like to keep a lid on too long. The one time during the screening where I felt I was having an out of body experience is where her character Jessi finally unleashes her emotions onto us the audience after years of being oppressed. The agony and anger is heard in her voice. Its evidence of why she has said acting is her true calling and how passionate she is about it. It would be stupid to still think shes a disney kid and still has something to prove. Her acting journey is truly so exciting as a fan of almost 2 decades.Lastly, Adrianas character is like the sunshine in the otherwise dark and twisted world the film lives in. She is poignant! And it perfectly complements the other 3 actresses work. She brings love and softness to the story through her work.One major thing to note is that this film is like an opera. It reminds one of the Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which was also almost entirely sung. Emotionally its definitely intense like one, with small moments of calm when you realise youre watching a film.The cinematography was brilliant. At the end of the film, selenas character lays almost unconscious on the passenger seat as her lover drives in rage. The way the camera pans across the car to her face... it felt like a painting, very poetic but tragic.So glad to have watched it before its netflix release. Its amazing when a film can make you feel like this. To take you out of your normal and drive you a bit crazy.",

         "Jacques Audiard tried to do too much",
         "Its a musical trans crime drama set in modern times in Mexico, Bangkok, Tel Aviv, Switzerland, and London, England. The two main characters are a Mexican lawyer, Rita Mora Castro , and a vicious cartel drug lord, Juan Manitas . Manitas has a wife, Jessi , and two children. After the film demonstrates Ritas legal capabilities, Manitas hires her to perform a service--find a surgeon willing to perform gender-affirming surgery secretly. Rita is also to resettle his family in Switzerland while Manitas fakes his death and becomes Emelia Pérez.Four years later, Emelia wants her children to live with her as their aunt in Mexico. Rita is again enlisted to assist with things. The film follows this initially successful transition that begins to sour as Jessi pursues a relationship with Gustavo and Emelia explores a relationship with Epifanía . It ends badly.With that plot, its hard to see musical numbers sustaining it. They mostly dont, except for one riveting dance number at a fundraising dinner by Zoe Saldana. The cinematography is occasionally stunning, but the plot jumps from scene to scene with many unresolved issues, e.g., why did the shootout end, and how did Emelia continue to function safely with drug lords after her transition? Jacques Audiard tried to do too much, and it didnt succeed.Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofia Gascón do very well; the direction is the issue.",

Seriously, who thought this was acceptable?The story might have had some potential, but even that was destroyed by how horribly written it was.

         "I really enjoy how director Jacques Audiard can embrace genre films, something that stands out in French filmmaking. You never know what to expect next with him, and certainly not a Spanish-language musical set in Mexico and featuring a trans mob boss.Its also interesting to see how the movie does not so much deal with transsexuality or identity but rather use that story as a starting point to ask whether people can change. Whether a criminal rotten to his/her core can become another person, and whether they can truly ever atone for their crimes. Beyond sex and gender, can you change your soul?That being said, the movie ultimately disappoints by leaving that theme aside in its last act, for the benefit of a rather bland kidnapping storyline. You feel like that our master criminal is sliding back toward their old violent habits... until the story drops the ball and goes in a disappointing direction. I was really looking forward to the resolution, a sign that the film was working for me, until I realized there was nothing more to expect from this movie. What a waste.The plot also sacrifices the Zoe Saldana character, who at first appears to be the protagonist, until she fades aways in the background. This points again at a screenplay that is good on buildup but weak on payoff.",

The fact that not a single Mexican actor graces the screen, a slap in the face to a rich culture and talented performers dealing with difficult themes.The music? An offensive assault on the ears. Its as if the composers Googled Mexican music and slapped together the first five results. No soul, no nuance, just a jarring cacophony. Sorry but hasta mi pinche vulva te extraña is so cringey in spanish!And the trans representation? The film reduces a complex and nuanced identity to a cheap plot device, lacking any genuine depth or respect into a couple of poorly written songs about de pene a vagina.Emilia Pérez is not just a bad movie, its an insult.",

         "Emilia Pérez is a 2024 musical drama starring Zoe Saldana as Rita, a lawyer that is doing her job until a drug lord kidnaps her and requests for a sex change. Along the way we have Selena Gomez play Jessi, the wife of the drug lord that adjusts to new life with the kids she raised with him after the sex change she doesnt know about. Then of course we have Karla Sofía Gascón play Emilia Pérez, the drug lord that changed gender and continues building her empire.Most of the story is delivered with musical numbers so if you dont like that type of genre, stay away from it. This film in particular had a very strange effect on me after it finished as I kind of went into it blind and to be honest, thats what you should do because the film in general is very unexpected in some places and quite comedic as well. After the director and cast of the film presented it to us, then the film started and the audience spread laughs and joy to some of the aspects of the film and I appreciate that. The film shines best with its amazing cinematography , powerhouse acting from all involved and some of the musical numbers.Now, why I say some of the musical numbers, is because most of them are pretty great and impactful to the story but as the film progressed the musical numbers became a lot less eye popping then before and became cliché because of this. The musical performance at the end was dull in my opinion but I think it sumed up some of the story a little bit. But dont listen to me though, as theres a film for everybody and I genuinely liked some of the elements of this film and I think most of you will too when it comes out soon enough.Overall, while not as greatly delivered as I hoped, Emilia Pérez is still a cinematic achievement in musical numbers and great acting that really makes the film all the more engaging and fun. If you like musicals, give Emilia Pérez a try, I think it does successfully deliver of what audiences can expect out of it.Grade: ALondon Film Festival opening gala.",

Zaldana in particular is the only one who is entertaining in her musical numbers becuase she is actually a good dancer and a comelling preformer. I almost felt sorry for Selena Gomez how could she look good when her songs and dialouge were so bad? But Saldana and Gascon kept me watching until the end.

         "Its interesting coming to Emilia Perez late, after its caused the stir it has. Watching the film, I was often thinking about whats rubbed people the wrong way, and different things that rubbed different people the wrong way. Lots of it can be interpreted charitably or cynically. Even then, how much of it is really supposed to be cynical is up to interpretation.But its already an overwhelming movie to think about, so I want to focus on what I personally liked and disliked. Im not going to passionately defend the film, but Im also not going to tear it to pieces.I thought it was an interesting film, I appreciated its boldness, I thought some of the acting was good , and some of its thrilling to watch. Its a movie that only sometimes comes alive, but I liked the energy in those scenes that did work. Its a movie that does a lot and asks questions in a way that obviously some people will respond well to and some people will lash out against. I think the film wants to be challenging.Still, even with that intent, Emilia Perez does sometimes feel confused in ways that might not be intentional. Some songs are clunky and repetitive, the editing is bad at times, and the narrative doesnt flow well. All three characters often feel like theyre off doing their own thing in their own movies, and jumping between each one sometimes felt head-scratching.It feels like a film where the people behind it wanted to do a lot, but mightve been overconfident, or more lost than they realised/wanted to admit. Its an imperfect shock not to the system, but to so many systems, and I dont know how many systems/things it was targeting necessarily.Thinking about this film wears me out , but I think for better or worse, itll kind of stick with me. I dont know if I want it to for too long. But I can say this: I dont think I regret watching it.",

         "Emelia PerezQuite frankly it was a terrible movie from start to finish with little redeeming features, what a waste of 2 hrs and 14 minutes of anyones life!The story can be summed up in very few words, a murderous Mexican Kingpin Druglord wants to escape and establish a new identity, this coincides with his desire to become a woman, and has been taking hormones for 2 years in advance in preparation for this moment, he flashes his breasts at Rita, the Lawyer to persuade her of his conviction to transition. Surprisingly a concurrent scene shows him with his wife and two children and she seems not to have noticed this additional cleavage lol!Oh well moving on, we then have a surgical interlude, 5 years pass and his widow and 2 children are relocated to Switzerland.The second half of the movie now begins with the Druglord reappearing as Emilia Perez, her new female identity, and reconnected with Rita, seemingly after 5 years he missed his children. Unbelievable!Suddenly Emilia was the Aunt, his widow and children were living with him and we had some presentation of happy families lol. Quite ridiculous!Emilia then embarked with Rita on reuniting the bodies of disappeared victims with their families, possibly victims of her past life. After various twists and turns Emilia gets killed in a botched kidnap attempt and she is elevated to that of a modern saint in the closing sequences.As you can see it was a bizarre and unbelievable tissue thin story, with numerous plot holes, populated by nasty stereotypes in the format of a Latino novella. The strange music grated, the stylised dancing was simplistic and derivative. It all moved at a glacial pace and was as dull as ditchwater and we just couldnt like or identify with any of the extreme characters. It was just a car crashing offending everyone!I am totally at a loss to understand the reviews and the ratings on here, I just wanted it to end. To give a high mark because there is a gender transition element, which, by the way is incidental to the story, because its trendy, is shocking and shallow, and equally wrong to elevate a movie because the movie is set in Mexico, a supposed unrepresented cinematic country.Any potential rating must be based upon the art product before us and this was beyond bad, Im going to give this a 3 out of 10 and that is a fair score for this tripe!",

         "This motion picture is one of the most celebrated and talked about films of the year 2024? And deserving of nominations and wins at some of the most prestigious events honoring excellence in the craft of filmmaking? I dont want to come across as some kind of conspiracy theorist but are the producers trying to perform every trick out of the hat to convince members of the Academy to select it for most noteworthy of award categories? Because when I think of the best of 2024, this does not even make it in the top five, let alone top 10 . I wouldnt even go far as to say it is among the worst of 2024, either, but really there isnt much going for it to give a recommendation.The film does not commit to a tone. One minute it wants to be a dark comedy, and then the next a very serious crime drama that provokes a bit of thought. The two could be balanced better if the script were given another pass, but as it is the clash creates a night and day difference and rather than come across as unique it feels like incompetence on the filmmakers part. The premise honestly could work as a comedy, and a thriller, but the lack of commitment creates a very strange experience that makes the whole thing seem so silly.The musical numbers do not add really anything to the film, are not catchy or memorable and feel very out of place when they arrive. Zoe Saldana is a good singer, but struggles to make these lyrics sound golden, Selena Gomez sings pretty good but the context to where the music comes into the picture feels forced in.Zoe Saldanas performance is good, but I dont think it is her best in her career as some outlets suggest. Selena Gomez is completely miscast. Karla Sofía Gascón and Adriana Paz are both quite good, but the script isnt up to level in quality. Edgar Ramirezs role could have easily been portrayed by anyone else, really. This isnt to say Ramirez is bad in the production, but his function seems to just be a recognizable face - far and away the best presentation of his acting talent.The representation of the drug problems in Mexico are terribly researched and portrayed wrong by the filmmakers. Was it hard to have done at least an hour of research into the topic? The presentation of transgenderism is also problematic, so changing your biological self means you are free of your past sins, really? Its saying something when organizations like GLAAD have not been very kind towards this picture.I personally do not think time will be very kind towards this movie, even if it wins all the awards at the 2025 Academy Awards.",

         "Emilia Perez really caused a stir. Theres so much controversy around this film, and so many who absolutely love it while so many detest it. Most of the criticism seem to come from Spanish speaking people. Since I dont speak Spanish and dont know anything about Mexican culture, I obviously cant comment on that aspect of the film. Therefore I will review it on its entertainment value .Shortly after winning a murder case, attorney Rita is contacted by crime boss Manitas. Tired of a life of violence, he wants to start a new life...as a woman. He requests Rita to do research on gender-affirming surgery, and promises to reward her richly. However, Manitas is married and he has children. In order from him to become the woman he always wanted to be, his family is to be told he was killed by his enemies.Four years after his surgery, Manitas is known as Emilia Perez. Longing for his family, he once again contacts Rita to ensure their reunion, with Emilia supposedly being their Aunt. Regretting his past, Emilia is now doing good in his new life, but - when things start going wrong - old habits seem to die hard...I absolutely love this movie! I love the music, the musical segments, and the performances by Zoe Saldana as Rita and Karla Sofía Gascón as Emilia Perez. Emilia Perez is a very different kind of musical, and I thought it was fresh and original. The film captured my attention from beginning to end.",

         "Interesting concept which the writers used cleverly. Its a musical so be prepared to see some songs here and there during dialogue. Its a unique story which keeps you guessing and you cant help but think whats next. Acting and casting are on point. Flow of the film in the beginning is delicately managed but later acquires a slower pace which I believe is there to engrain character development and invoke emotional appeal. I wont comment on the ending as it would give it away and kill the anticipation that was so carefully built.Its definitely not a conventional film. I would say you would be shocked from time to time but at one point you will just become immune to it especially to the eccentric characters and bold storyline. Cinematography and direction are commendable as well.",

         "I want to be clear. I agree this movie is denigrating to the Mexican community and the trans community which by itself makes it an absolute disgrace. As a movie by itself it is truly one of the biggest pieces of garbage I have ever seen. Zoe Saldana is fine, but the acting from every other person is quite frankly abhorrent. Selena Gomez is truly shocking in both her grasp of Spanish and her singing. How this movie has garnered so much critical praise is beyond me. I feel it serves as a huge reminder with how deluded Hollywood is. Do not waste your time with this. You will wish you could have the time back.",

         "Watched at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sep. 14th, 2024 Format: Regular theatreRating: 8/10Im surprised how this film is able to be so many things at the same time. Comedy, drama, action, thriller, self-exploration, AND MUSICAL. It balances each genre and gives it enough time in a way that wont make it seem too much.Each acting performance in this film is outstanding specifically Zoe Saldana in the first half of the film and Karla Sofía Gascón in the second half of the film who played two roles in this film perfectly. Unfortunately, everything related to Selena Gomez in terms of her acting performance and character needed more effort to be put in. Very weak character that was just there as a filler to make things more complicated for the main protagonist and the events of the story.Though musicals arent my thing, this film dealt with that part in such a unique way that made each song performance creative in terms of the directing and lyrics. Two songs that really grabbed my attention is one that touched on a political aspect in Mexico that had such a creative and unique direction to it. The other one really proved Zoe Saldanas performance as it was great with all of the dark and minimum lighting that it had.",

         "Original movie with a lot of creativity.The good: you get some insight of transgenders, spanish musical singing , actrice zoe and karla, the setting and the way you can feel the mexico vibe, some parts of the story where you can clearly feel the quality of the director, the movie is very orginial.The bad: the biggest problem is that they portray a drugs maffia lord, responsible for 10000 deaths or missing, later on as a good house wife with a good moral sense. That is just a big clap in the face of all people who lost someone because of the drugs wars in reality. The whole basis of this movie just feels wrong and without respect to those people.What is more bad? It is too long, selena gomez , all main actrices are woman , script, story line and a clear goal or motive is missing. What is the point or goal off any of the 3 main actrices of this movie? There is none.Just a 6 out of 10.",

         "Greetings from Lithuania.Emilia Pérez is a very good movie, a unique one and with a multilayered story. This is not a typic musical, and i can safely say that even if you do not like musicals do your self a favor and watch this film because its not really even a musical in any conventional way. Performances were excellent by all 3 leads, but its the directing of this movie was the most strongest aspect. I did enjoyed Rust and Bone some years ago even more then Emilia Pérez, but they both have similar tones and vibes. This movie has a wild story and i really enjoyed it.Overall, at running time 2 hours this movie barely drags and its one of the most original films of 2024 that i urge you to see.

The music isnt terrible, in fact some of the performances are great and very well choreographed and put together, others not so much, especially that viral one!The movie has pacing issues. Its a good start but a somewhere in the middle it gets lost before the end where it finds itself again. That was a shame to me. It was probably 20-30 minutes too long.Overall its a different movie with interesting themes and some superb performances.",

Its filled with bad references and cringeworthy moments that make it feel like a parody of itself. A true humiliation for Mexican cinema and culture. The fact that it received nominations and awards only proves how biased and sold-out these institutions are. Dont waste your time on this movie. There are plenty of better films out there.

You have a sex change intimidation by a vicious gangster, a painful love story that cannot possibly work out, action and violence and to top it off the film is a musical.

         "What's wrong with the cinema industry? 13 Oscars nominations?",
         "I once heard that one of the great elements that should not be missing in a good script is emotionality, the construction of emotions and a good dose of sentimentality, so that the audience is hooked either to the characters, to the situations or to both. Of course, its an element that must be combined with several others and mixed in the right and necessary quantities so that we can have a good story to see and tell. Well, Emilia Pérez has none of that. Zero. Nothing. There is no emotional construction of any character. The audience is bombarded with very direct situations that seem to be simulating a reality that seems, from its foundation, implausible. All this is done in a serious and apparently respectful manner, but its like paying tribute to something abstract and indefinite.The performances dont help. This is the worst Selena Gomez I have ever seen. Full of melodramatic exaggerations in a niche she doesnt belong in, and making it seem like she was acting reluctantly and forcefully. Even their songs in the movie are horribly performed. None of the songs are good, in any case. The rest of the cast has very discreet performances with the exception of Zoe Saldaña, who is the best in the film, however, I dont think its enough for her to star in the awards season.I empathize with the Mexican audience who has complained about all the cultural inaccuracies. I agree with everything that has already been mentioned before. This is a story about Mexico, made by people who are not Mexican and who didnt even care to look Mexican.Regarding the gender identity part of the story, I think its a mockery. Its an extreme situation that is very difficult to believe. An attempt is made to be inclusive with a delicate topic to end up being disastrously offensive with another ultra-sensitive topic such as the victims of extreme violence due to drug trafficking and gangs. Its thus a story without a head or tail, which was attempted to be put together to purposely polemicize and nothing else. Its really a shame that such poorly planned projects are given space, perhaps leaving out much better ones.I dont want to close this review without first saying that the global film industry is very wrong if they believe that this is being inclusive, because this is a joke in very bad taste. Its a scandal that a film like this is celebrated with so many nominations and awards. Absolutely an aberration.",

         "Emilia Perez Is a drama thriller musical centred around a cartel boss and their lawyer. Whist I was somewhat invested throughout the film, my main issue is that it did not commit to any of its premises which left the experience feeling very surface level with the most memorable part being that it tried to combine several genres together.It didnt commit to being a thriller which meant there was nothing fresh regarding these elements. The plot allowed allowing anything that might have been intriguing to simply happen by chance which removed the tension from these scenes. The musical numbers werent particularly entertaining and the drama concerning the protagonist wasnt explored in a way that gave me meaningful insight into the character and their emotions. So whilst the mishmash of genres was intriguing, little else was memorable with the exception of Zoe Saldanas performance.",

In what world this is a good idea? This is offensive, the stereotypes are too high, why lucrate with a theme so delicate as the people who is lost bc narcotrafic? This is a sensitive theme in Mexico, you put this into a comedy?Lets laugh about a tragedy in the US in a comedy with french actors then? Would the academy like that?Zoe Saldaña is an incredible Actor who shouldnt have been involved in this mess. Withouth her, this movie would be in the garbage where it belongs. Of course they needed Selena for audiences too.If they didnt had them, or similar actresses hot on Hollywood, this mediocre film wouldnt be as famous as it is.In the end scene, this movie puts a red ribbon into the hate for Mexicans, making the bad stereotypes as strong as in a Trump speech, Dumb Mexicans would idolize a Martir even if she was a Narco seriously? Did the director saw a December 9 video of La basilica de Guadalupe and tought Mexicans love to pray to a plastic figure?Offensive piece of crap with ridiculous attempt of Mexican representation, so cringy to watch, so ridiculous that is praised for first world critics who dont have a slightly idea of what Mexico is.",

         "One of the best movies from Cannes",
         "My second favorite movie from Cannes after The Substance . Its pure insanity. Musical about drug dealers and corruption in Mexico??? WTF???Emilia Perez is really inventive. It blends a lot of different genres: drama, comedy, musical, thriller, but does it in a very good and entertaining way. Its also extremely original and also suprisingly emotional. There is a character in here that has a moving and heartbreaking journey throughout the movie. Im not gonna go into details. Its not really a spoiler cause its revealed in first 15-20 minutes into the movie but I didnt knew about it and I was shocked that this movie went into that direction. Thats why advise you not to read description and to go see it fully blind if u want to have the best possible experience.The best thing about this Emilia Perez are definitely perfomances. It won Best Actress Award at Cannes for as many as 4 perfomances . Saldana plays the main character and has a lot of intense and showy scenes . Im happy that after all these blockbusters she finally got the role where she could show her acting chops. Gascon plays titular character. Its kinda supporting role but tbh shes the heart of the movie and the whole plot takes place around her. Gomez and Paz were good but Im suprised they also won the Palme - their perfomances wasnt as great and memorable as Saldanas and Gascons.Jacques Audiards vision is bold and impressive. This movie is stylish and looks beautiful. I love the cinematography and score. Not eveything works perfectly and there were a few moments where I wasnt fully sold out on this but most of the time, I was enjoying it and I was amazed by its craziness, ingenuity and originality. Im not a big fan of musicals but the musical scenes in that movie are gripping and very well choreographed shot which makes them enjoyable to watch. The songs are catchy and memorable .Emilia Perez is not for everyone. Some people were walking out, some were saying its one of the worst movies of the festival, some were loving it . General public is not gonna love this. The closest movie to this Ive saw is Annette by Leos Carax. Emilia Perez is more crowd-pleasing, but its still gonna miss with a lot of people. But I still encourage you to see it. Lets support weird and niche cinema.",

         "Saldana is GREAT! The rest? \"Meh\"",
         "To say that the Spanish-language French musical crime film, EMILIA PEREZ is audacious does not do justice to the word AUDACIOUS. It is like saying that a Giant Redwood is a tree.Written and Directed by Jacques Audiard , EMILIA PEREZ tells the squalid tale of a Mexican crime druglord who decides to transition to a new life as a female - not to escape from his enemies, but to run to the person he/she felt she always has been.Oh...and did I mention it was a musical?The Grand Jury Prize winner at Cannes EMILIA PEREZ has a lot going for it starting with the audacity of the premise...and deciding to do it as a musical.The music works and sets the dark, dingy mood of the film and the characters within. However, be warned, there is no DEFYING GRAVITY in this film. The characters remain grounded in reality and the songs are dour and moody with nary a flying monkey in sight.Zoe Saldana is a well-deserved Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actress as the Lawyer that drug Kingpin Juan Manitas Del Monte hires to help with the transition. It is a career best performance by Saldana and she carries the emotional heart and soul of this film on her shoulders and she bears it well. She won the Golden Globe for her efforts here and should be considered a front-runner for the Oscar, shes that good.Its a good thing that Saldana is so strong because all of the rest of the characters are thinly written with little to no depth to them so performers like Selena Gomez and Edgar Ramirez look fairly narcissistic as they focus only on themselves and think nothing of anyone else.And, the same can be said for the title character played by Gascon. Her Manitas/Emilia Perez comes off fairly one-dimensional and all of her actions seem selfish and self-absorbed and, quite frankly, I didnt care what happens to this character through the course of the film.And that, ultimately, sinks this film as EMILIA PEREZ is, really, a two-hander between Saldanas character and Garcons character and trans-actor Garcon is just not strong enough to bring any emotional range and heft to her scenes and she is dismissed off the screen when a true movie veteran like Saldana gives a career best performance.Director/Writer Audiard helms this piece with sure-handedness, knowing exactly the type of movie he wanted to bring to the screen and his laser-sharp focus on this fever-dream of a film is aided by an unwavering vision of by filmmaker. He should be applauded - but maybe not rewarded with an Oscar - for his vision.A darling of the industry - it garnered 13 Oscar nominations - Emilia Perez, is an audacious attempt at doing something different and artsy, but mostly misses the mark .Letter Grade: B7 stars and you can take that to the Bank",

         "The title says it all, I absolutely hated this film, to the point where my partner and I noped out after about an hour and half.Caveat to begin with, I am not a fan of musicals as a rule, I can make exceptions if the songs are very good. Unfortunately the songs in Emilia Perez are not good. Very very not good.As everyone else has noted, its been very well shot, very colourful and some of the choreography during the unendurable song and dance numbers was pretty good.Alas this good cinematopgraphy did not help make these sequences any more enjoyable mind you. Each song and dance number causes the overall story to screech to a halt. This is super frustrating as there are moments where it seems like there could be an interesting story at play, but these are soon washed away with another super cringey and cheesy song.The story as it is about a trans woman who changes their personality completely after transitioning is insulting tom the trans community as well as being utterly ridiculous.Zoe Saldana is giving everything 110% so respect to her, I only wish the film were worthy of her efforts. Everyone else was lousy, especially Selena Gomez who with all her financial resources youd think could afford a dialect coach.Im not sure what the critics and award voters are seeing in this one.

         "I am Mexican, and I can tell you that this movie is an awful representation of the narcotics problem in Mexico. While the story initially seemed interesting, it quickly became ridiculous. The main premise of the film is that a cruel assassin drug lord becomes a martyr after losing his penis. Additionally, Selenas acting is subpar; she cant even speak Spanish well, despite being cast as a Mexican character. None of the main actors are Mexican, and their Spanish accents come from Spain and the Caribbean, and frankly incomprehensible in Selenas case.Overall, a good idea turned into a bad movie.",

         "A Tone-Deaf Musical Disaster",
         "Emilia Pérez has sparked significant controversy, and for good reason. From the outset, the lack of Mexican representation like a glaring oversight. The French directors admission that he didnt feel the need to research Mexico, paired with the casting directors claim that no talented Mexican actors could be found, only adds insult to injury. These choices reflect a tone-deaf and dismissive approach to authenticity.Whats even more baffling is how Emilia Pérez managed to garner so many Oscar nominations. While the Academy has a history of nominating films with problematic undertones , those at least offered stories that entertained broad audiences. Emilia Pérez, however, doesnt even accomplish that. The story is dull and lifeless, so much so that out of three of us who watched it, two fell asleep, and the third decided to switch to another movie.To make matters worse, Emilia Pérez is a musical - but not in a good way. The songs are forgettable at best and cringe-worthy at worst, and most of the cast can barely sing. The musical numbers, which should have been a highlight, drag the movie down even further.That said, there are a couple of redeeming elements. Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón deliver strong performances and truly dont deserve the backlash tied to the films broader issues. Their nominations are the only ones that feel genuinely earned. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a mess.Overall, Emilia Pérez is an underwhelming, uninspired production that fails to justify the attention its received.",

         "okay, so",
         "The problem with this movie is not Selenas Spanish, I dont find this movie particularly bad but some of the dialogue is really cringy and as a Mexican none of the people from here use the terms that were in the movie. The portrayal of Mexico in this film is very stereotypical and sometimes that isnt bad, but I think they should had cast real Latin writers and supervisors to make this movie more accurate and respectful to the country. The fact that the director doesnt speak Spanish or even English speaks volumes of the commitment to understanding what the movie is about and the emotions that triggers.Also the songs are horrible.The only thing salvageable is Zoe Saldañas performance.",

         "Emilia Perez: Ambitious Themes, Incomplete Execution",
         "Emilia Perez isnt a bad movie, but it felt somewhat flat. At times, the story seemed too easy for the characters, lacking tension or conflict. Emilia, in particular, transforms into an overwhelmingly positive character, even though we know from the backstory that she wasnt always so good.The movie tackles a wide range of themes but struggles to fully explore them. Instead of diving deeply into any one idea, it spreads itself too thin, leaving several threads underdeveloped.As someone who doesnt typically enjoy musicals, this film didnt change my mind. However, I can appreciate that this was the directors vision, and I know many viewers will enjoy the musical elements. To its credit, some of the musical numbers were well done, especially those performed by Zoe Saldana. Her performance was a standout and arguably the films biggest revelation, elevating many scenes with her presence and talent.Overall, Emilia Perez is an enjoyable film. While I dont quite understand its acclaim at Cannes, it has its moments.",

         "Emilia Pérez is, at best, just okay. It feels incredibly overhyped, and I honestly dont understand how its winning so many awards. Zoe Saldana delivers a strong performance, but the rest of the cast is just average.The film tries to mix crime, drama, and musical elements, but the execution is uneven. Some scenes drag, making the pacing feel sluggish, and the emotional moments often seem forced rather than genuine. While the cinematography and production design are impressive, the storytelling lacks depth. Its a film that aims high but doesnt fully deliver. A 6/10 for me-decent but forgettable.",

         "Hard to watch",
         "Emilia Pérez is a musical that has sparked debate due to its themes and execution, particularly in Mexico, where its release has been surrounded by controversy. I watched it with an open mind, aware of its narrative, focus, and genre. However, I came away with mixed feelings, which I will break down into three key points: stereotypes, performances, and the script along with the songs.1. Stereotypes: Its impossible to discuss this movie without addressing its cultural treatment. From the very beginning, it feels more like a collection of clichés about Mexico than a genuine exploration of its culture. As a Mexican, Im not offended by stereotypes per se, but here, there seems to be no interest in delving deeper. It feels like a brainstorm of references-sombreros, skulls, and tequila-without adding anything meaningful to the narrative. This lack of authenticity turns the setting into a caricature. The production could have set the story in any other country, swapped these clichés for others, and it wouldnt have made much difference to the plot.2. Performances: Its interesting that the performances have been nominated for multiple awards. However, as a Spanish speaker, the accent and diction were constant distractions. The actresses seem to be trying hard, but the result fails to convey genuine emotions or connect with the audience. A crucial part of acting is mastering dialogue delivery, intonation, and how these elements evoke empathy or rejection toward the characters. This doesnt happen here. No character made me feel their story-I didnt suffer with them or celebrate their victories.3. Script and songs: The script, unfortunately, is one of the films weakest points. The dialogues feel as though they were mechanically translated into Spanish, riddled with errors in conjugation and awkward phrases. This extends to the songs, which fail to work as either music or narrative tools. In a good musical, the songs should integrate organically and move the story forward, but here, they feel forced, as if they were shoehorned into a pre-existing structure without concern for rhythm or coherence.4. The theme: The film touches on a sensitive nerve for Mexicans. Its complicated to humanize drug cartels in a country that suffers the direct consequences of violence, disappearances, and daily fear. The idea of portraying a drug lord as someone deserving of redemption, who wishes to transition to stay true to their identity and even becomes a benefactor of social causes, can feel insulting. For a foreign audience, it might be an interesting narrative, but for those living in the reality of drug-related violence, this idealization borders on indifference toward collective suffering.In conclusion, Emilia Pérez has some interesting technical elements and isolated moments worth noting, but as a whole, its not an enjoyable film. The lack of authenticity in its cultural representation, performances that fail to connect, and a weak script weigh it down too much. That said, cinema is subjective, and if this movie finds its audience, good for it. But for me, rather than being a captivating musical, it was a frustrating experience.",

         "This is an ambitious film that certainly succeeds in combining several genres. It is also a film that manages to fascinate and captivate for its whole, long running time.However, there are two major problems: First: the film is ridiculously moralistic.Second: it is absurd to believe that nobody would immediately question the identity and therefore the background of the main character. Her motivation is legit, she wants to make amends, but it is mindboggling that the filmmakers apparently thought it could go unquestioned when the protagonist, a mysterious woman in every respect, carelessly decides to enter the spotlight.",

Why was Rita selected, how she managed to do so many illegal stuff like an expert just with money, nohing explained! Can a lawyer do all of these? Anyways, I couldnt find any fault jn Gustavo. He didnt even know that Emilia was Manitas before his death! And after all that Emilia did, are we supposed to feel sorry for her? She was a cartel leader, did lots of bad stuff and at the end also did bad stuff forcing his children to stay with him without explaining anything to his wife! I feel bad for the kids. Their father ruined the whole family by running after his personal gains only. He never thought of anyone else but himself.And why is Rita always with them? I mean does she have no family or close ones? Rita and Emilia did lots of illegal stuff to get rich and the film tried to justify it by sentiment and emotion. And people are praising them for the NGO whereas they themselves are twisted. The song where Rita mocks the corrupt people also doesnt make sense as she herself did illegal stuffs to get rich!Some of the visuals are good and thats why Ive rated it higher, otherwise this is garbage.",

         "Just finished watching Emilia Perez and it was fine I guess. There is a lot to like and dislike in this movie.Positives for Emilia Perez : The movie looks good with some great cinematography. The movie does get ambitious with the blending of genre thrown into the mix and I appreciate that. The performances from Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofia Gascon are very good. The musical numbers are fun to watch. And finally, I thought that the movie did a great job at telling its transgender story.Mixed for Emilia Perez : While the movie is certainly ambitious with its blending of genres, there are elements to this that felt out of place in this movie. The musical numbers feel like they just came out of nowhere and it felt jarring at times.Negatives for Emilia Perez : The movie is way too long and I feel that this movie couldve told its story with a shorter runtime. The movie lost my interest almost immediately and it just became background noise for me.Overall, I admired the filmmakers and actors for being ambitious with this movie, it just fully worked for me. However, I would still recommend this movie to people, if they are interested with this movie.",

The spanish speakers characters can barely pronounce two words, turning the whole script into an uncomfortable caricature.

The only valuable thing is the attempt to offer something different by mixing a Spanish language film with a musical, however its execution becomes irritating to watch. Im sure any positive reviews must come from someone totally unfamiliar with the Spanish language, as this is a determining factor in making this film totally inedible and a endless meme material.",

The first two are played by Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofia Gascón, the second two by Selena Gomez and Adriana Paz. This quartet shared the Best Actress award at Cannes 2024. They deserved it. Saldaña in particular is a revelation.Of writer-director Jacques Audiards previous films, Ive seen four , each memorable in their different ways. None of them prepared me for this one, so hats of to him for not getting stuck in a genre rut.Theres a lot of story and a lot of singing in Emilia Pérez. When the singing is paired with Damien Jalets incisive choreography, the effect is thrilling. Otherwise, the songs drag the movie down. They are musical-theatre lite, dont dig deep, so are not up to the dramatic demands put upon them. Theyre at their best in the rap-inclined numbers, where rhythm is the most important element.The moral of Emilia Pérez seems to be that we can never slough off the past, change who we are or what we want. Its a strangely bleak vision to present in a musical.",

         "Came to write this after seeing its gala screening at the London film festival.A wild, insane roller coaster of a film that mixes crime, comedy, musical and thriller all into one and succeeds with flying colours!The four actresses at the core are the strength and they were directed to perfection by Audiard.Karla plays her character pre transition and post as it comes to her naturally, having underdone it publicly as an actor. Its a powerhouse performance that is so of our time. Im proud to be alive in a time when a trans actress plays a trans role. And not only that, she nails it. The tragedy of leaving a life but the promise of the one shes always needed.Zoe gets to sing, dance, cry and laugh and everything which I think an actor dreams of doing, let alone in one film. I had never seen a film of hers before and I am so happy this was my first because she shines! Theres a scene of her in a car, where realising what has just transpired, she breaks down in hysteria. Think Margo in I, Tonya or Glenn in Dangerous Liasons. That scene alone should win her an Academy award. And she has a beautiful voice!Selena, for whom I was most excited to see this film, kicks it out of the ballpark. Playing a mob wife, that icy, storm-simmering-below-the-surface kind of woman which she needs to revisit IMO because as a young girl who endured intense scrutiny and then went through a psychosis, she knows it too well whats it like to keep a lid on too long. The one time during the screening where I felt I was having an out of body experience is where her character Jessi finally unleashes her emotions onto us the audience after years of being oppressed. The agony and anger is heard in her voice. Its evidence of why she has said acting is her true calling and how passionate she is about it. It would be stupid to still think shes a disney kid and still has something to prove. Her acting journey is truly so exciting as a fan of almost 2 decades.Lastly, Adrianas character is like the sunshine in the otherwise dark and twisted world the film lives in. She is poignant! And it perfectly complements the other 3 actresses work. She brings love and softness to the story through her work.One major thing to note is that this film is like an opera. It reminds one of the Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which was also almost entirely sung. Emotionally its definitely intense like one, with small moments of calm when you realise youre watching a film.The cinematography was brilliant. At the end of the film, selenas character lays almost unconscious on the passenger seat as her lover drives in rage. The way the camera pans across the car to her face... it felt like a painting, very poetic but tragic.So glad to have watched it before its netflix release. Its amazing when a film can make you feel like this. To take you out of your normal and drive you a bit crazy.",

         "Its a musical trans crime drama set in modern times in Mexico, Bangkok, Tel Aviv, Switzerland, and London, England. The two main characters are a Mexican lawyer, Rita Mora Castro , and a vicious cartel drug lord, Juan Manitas . Manitas has a wife, Jessi , and two children. After the film demonstrates Ritas legal capabilities, Manitas hires her to perform a service--find a surgeon willing to perform gender-affirming surgery secretly. Rita is also to resettle his family in Switzerland while Manitas fakes his death and becomes Emelia Pérez.Four years later, Emelia wants her children to live with her as their aunt in Mexico. Rita is again enlisted to assist with things. The film follows this initially successful transition that begins to sour as Jessi pursues a relationship with Gustavo and Emelia explores a relationship with Epifanía . It ends badly.With that plot, its hard to see musical numbers sustaining it. They mostly dont, except for one riveting dance number at a fundraising dinner by Zoe Saldana. The cinematography is occasionally stunning, but the plot jumps from scene to scene with many unresolved issues, e.g., why did the shootout end, and how did Emelia continue to function safely with drug lords after her transition? Jacques Audiard tried to do too much, and it didnt succeed.Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofia Gascón do very well; the direction is the issue.",

You never know what to expect next with him, and certainly not a Spanish-language musical set in Mexico and featuring a trans mob boss.Its also interesting to see how the movie does not so much deal with transsexuality or identity but rather use that story as a starting point to ask whether people can change. Whether a criminal rotten to his/her core can become another person, and whether they can truly ever atone for their crimes. Beyond sex and gender, can you change your soul?That being said, the movie ultimately disappoints by leaving that theme aside in its last act, for the benefit of a rather bland kidnapping storyline. You feel like that our master criminal is sliding back toward their old violent habits... until the story drops the ball and goes in a disappointing direction. I was really looking forward to the resolution, a sign that the film was working for me, until I realized there was nothing more to expect from this movie. What a waste.The plot also sacrifices the Zoe Saldana character, who at first appears to be the protagonist, until she fades aways in the background.

I cant believe how I fell in love with Amelia Perez because one shouldnt but I did.The music too was emotive especially Papa sung by Amelias son.I dont understand the negative reviews but I do understand why it has been nominated for so many Academy Awards.Only in very well thought out films can one be sucked into caring for a character which in life one really should not.This film is about truth and redemption as much as it is about understanding our own identities.",

         "The critiques of this movie as inauthentic and cringy are not wrong. In particular the music was really bad, the songs are barely songs, theyre more like chants. On the other hand this movie tells a unique story and has great preformances by Zoe Saldana and Karla Gascon. Zaldana in particular is the only one who is entertaining in her musical numbers becuase she is actually a good dancer and a comelling preformer. I almost felt sorry for Selena Gomez how could she look good when her songs and dialouge were so bad? But Saldana and Gascon kept me watching until the end. I think this would have been much better as a drama and not a musical. And as for people who will say that this is not Mexican, well they are right about that.",

         "Its interesting coming to Emilia Perez late, after its caused the stir it has. Watching the film, I was often thinking about whats rubbed people the wrong way, and different things that rubbed different people the wrong way. Lots of it can be interpreted charitably or cynically. Even then, how much of it is really supposed to be cynical is up to interpretation.But its already an overwhelming movie to think about, so I want to focus on what I personally liked and disliked. Im not going to passionately defend the film, but Im also not going to tear it to pieces.I thought it was an interesting film, I appreciated its boldness, I thought some of the acting was good , and some of its thrilling to watch. Its a movie that only sometimes comes alive, but I liked the energy in those scenes that did work. Its a movie that does a lot and asks questions in a way that obviously some people will respond well to and some people will lash out against. I think the film wants to be challenging.Still, even with that intent, Emilia Perez does sometimes feel confused in ways that might not be intentional. Some songs are clunky and repetitive, the editing is bad at times, and the narrative doesnt flow well. All three characters often feel like theyre off doing their own thing in their own movies, and jumping between each one sometimes felt head-scratching.It feels like a film where the people behind it wanted to do a lot, but mightve been overconfident, or more lost than they realised/wanted to admit. Its an imperfect shock not to the system, but to so many systems, and I dont know how many systems/things it was targeting necessarily.Thinking about this film wears me out , but I think for better or worse, itll kind of stick with me. I dont know if I want it to for too long. But I can say this: I dont think I regret watching it.",

As a movie by itself it is truly one of the biggest pieces of garbage I have ever seen. Zoe Saldana is fine, but the acting from every other person is quite frankly abhorrent. Selena Gomez is truly shocking in both her grasp of Spanish and her singing. How this movie has garnered so much critical praise is beyond me.

That is just a big clap in the face of all people who lost someone because of the drugs wars in reality. The whole basis of this movie just feels wrong and without respect to those people.What is more bad?

Whist I was somewhat invested throughout the film, my main issue is that it did not commit to any of its premises which left the experience feeling very surface level with the most memorable part being that it tried to combine several genres together.It didnt commit to being a thriller which meant there was nothing fresh regarding these elements. The plot allowed allowing anything that might have been intriguing to simply happen by chance which removed the tension from these scenes. The musical numbers werent particularly entertaining and the drama concerning the protagonist wasnt explored in a way that gave me meaningful insight into the character and their emotions. So whilst the mishmash of genres was intriguing, little else was memorable with the exception of Zoe Saldanas performance.",

In what world this is a good idea? This is offensive, the stereotypes are too high, why lucrate with a theme so delicate as the people who is lost bc narcotrafic?

Of course they needed Selena for audiences too.If they didnt had them, or similar actresses hot on Hollywood, this mediocre film wouldnt be as famous as it is.In the end scene, this movie puts a red ribbon into the hate for Mexicans, making the bad stereotypes as strong as in a Trump speech, Dumb Mexicans would idolize a Martir even if she was a Narco seriously? Did the director saw a December 9 video of La basilica de Guadalupe and tought Mexicans love to pray to a plastic figure?Offensive piece of crap with ridiculous attempt of Mexican representation, so cringy to watch, so ridiculous that is praised for first world critics who dont have a slightly idea of what Mexico is.",

Unfortunately the songs in Emilia Perez are not good. Very very not good.As everyone else has noted, its been very well shot, very colourful and some of the choreography during the unendurable song and dance numbers was pretty good.Alas this good cinematopgraphy did not help make these sequences any more enjoyable mind you. Each song and dance number causes the overall story to screech to a halt. This is super frustrating as there are moments where it seems like there could be an interesting story at play, but these are soon washed away with another super cringey and cheesy song.The story as it is about a trans woman who changes their personality completely after transitioning is insulting tom the trans community as well as being utterly ridiculous.Zoe Saldana is giving everything 110% so respect to her, I only wish the film were worthy of her efforts. Everyone else was lousy, especially Selena Gomez who with all her financial resources youd think could afford a dialect coach.Im not sure what the critics and award voters are seeing in this one.

It was like her entire script got run through Google Translate, twice. I speak Spanish, and even I needed subtitles to understand her. Honestly, it felt like the movie was actively trying to insult my brain.The plot had potential-Ill give it that-but it was buried under layers of cringe-worthy acting and a bafflingly tone-deaf approach. The director must have skipped the Mexican culture and language section during research . And dont even get me started on how wildly insensitive this movie is to families dealing with real-life disappearances.In conclusion, this movie didnt just miss the mark-it missed the entire target, fell off the stage, and took the audiences patience with it.",

I have to say, the first few minutes, I almost turned it off, but then, Zoe Saldanha drew me in, and I found myself utterly charmed...I have loved Zoe since I saw her many years ago in Center Stage, she constantly delivered great work through the years, and I have to say I am very happy that she finally has the role that will bring her some real awards attention. She is co lead in this film, and should go lead, but I get it, in supporting she might actually get to go all the way and win the Oscar?! This is the role of het lifetime , and she is brilliant in it. There is a scene, at a benefit, and she starts to sing and dance... took my breath away.Selena Gomez, like Zoe, I have loved since her Wizards days, very happy to see her doing so well in her acting career, and she also, gives a fantastic, very mature grown up performance. She is the supporting actress here, I hope she also gets a nomination at least.This is my first time watching Karla Sofia Gascon in anything, and yes, she really delivers, stealing every scene, very raw, emotional, fierce, fiery... so many words I can use to describe her performance. I really hope she gets that nomination. I am writing this on 14.11.2024, and watching the chatter online, I do hope she makes history and can go all the way to the Kodak theatre.The camera work, the music, the story and message at the core of the film are all really interesting and will make you think. The film has a certain rhythm, a beat, at certain points I found myself tapping my feat.There are a few songs where the lyrics were a bit strange and will make some people cringe, but I think it may just me the spanish to english translation.For all movie lovers, movie buffs, awards watchers, go see the film, it really is a great one.

         "A devious yet frequently overlooked Mexico City defense attorney, Rita, attracts the attention of Manitas, a notorious drug lord and criminal mastermind. Manitas has an interesting request and one that Rita entertains at her peril. For staging his murder, secretly obtaining the perfect surgeon, and providing for his family, Manitas will make Rita rich. The trick is that he will be reborn as she; Emilia. Things go well for a time, but the past begins to creep back. Emilia misses her kids and wife, and doesnt like the new influences on their lives. Emilia struggles to live half in one life, and half in another.This combined narco-thriller, musical, romance, comedy, character-driven social piece, and gender affirmation drama is mind-blowing. The film bumps around to different and interesting locations around the world too. While the film has many plot twists, director Jacques Audiard maintains firm control of the narrative. I really admire and appreciate his work. It is amazing that a film can be so thrilling and funny, and yet manage to get in a plug about the 100,000 plus people who have disappeared in Mexico due to drug violence, but Audiard does it.True to the films multi-faceted and surprising nature, the actors won a combined award at the Cannes film festival for their roles .The film is intriguing and fascinating because it never loses sight of the human nature component. Emilias feelings are natural for what someone in her shoes might ask and wonder about. For example, was she really in love and did people love her? Further, I am enthralled with the French style, particularly its rawness. No one pulls any punches, and no censors are active with their censoring.

There are no mexican actors in the movie. It shows how the director did not care about make a properly research. This films just gives cringe. I cant understand how this piece of garbage is nominated to Oscars, and had won some awards. And the people that is praising this movie does not know anything about the real sitaution, if not there is no way that this could have positive reactions. In resume this is an insult and shouldnt be considerarse as a great film.",

         "I watched this masterpiece, as described by Micheal Mann on stage introducing the film, at the opening night of the American French Film Festival in LA. The theatre was full, supporters riding high from collecting accolades at Cannes all the way around to the film festivals circuit, with crew heads held high. And what applauds they deserve. The actors, the plot, the depths of emotion, camera shots and storytelling was absolutely brilliant. The dancing, moving, script, colors, visuals...its not about man meets woman, its about anything you want it to be. Those scenes were shot in Paris recreating the stress of Mexico City, just like the plot was meant for you to recreate it any which meaning you want it to give.",

         "I didnt found the movie that bad to be honest but there are some things that bothered me during my time watching it .Im not really fan about how they balanced things between musical and serious moments: there are some times that i felt that even the actors didnt know how they performed when there was some serious moment or musical . Even the musical part i was not that fan : for me it was a lot of noise and it get pretty distracting when they revealing some part of the stories while singing . I was not a big fan of this.But for me the thing that i really enjoyed and i think the most interesting thing in that movie was that trio : Emilia , Jessi and Rita .It was very interesting because Emilia was a man before , she was the ex husband of Jessi and Rita know that .And after that it was an interesting game between all these elements : When Jessi announce she is getting married and will bring the kids with her in front of Emilia and us as a viewer we know who is Emilia and we know it will not go very well . And at the same time we know the movie will offer that confrontation between Jessi and Emilia and the truth will be revealed .I like that kind of suspense and when she knows , she knows .I love also that scene when Jessi , Rita and Emilia was on the phones and we saw how Rita tried to handle every person during the big problem between Emilia , Jessi .It have some interesting moments also all along but the beginning took some times to really give the real interest , in my opinion, in that movie .I was a little bit scared at first : i was very confusing and didnt understand what that movie was really about : the trailer didnt give too much info too . But after a few moments we know whats going to happen and it generate suspense and interest to the movie again but once again the musical part was not that necessary in my opinion and sometimes was too much distracting sadly.But i appreciate it anyway and found it a little bit long for what the movie is really about .So im still mixed feeling about this movie and its clearly not for everyone but i appreciate the trio Emilia, Rita, Jessi and i love the musical when it was Jessi who performed on the bed : it was very sensual .But what i love also its that we saw a lot of womens on screen and its a really good thing in my opinion and i enjoyed watching it . Despite not liking the musical part , i need to say that the visuals make it pleaseant anyway .We had also that side story about workers and bad conditions of work but it was not really that impactful in my opinion. There was also some moments where i felt also that the movie lack clearly of directions but its watchable and i think after a while when you will see what the movie is really about it will be suspensful and interesting despite a long and slow build .Good Anyway.",

I mean people study acting or musical theatre for years but nooo this is the cast that they came up.Selenas character could be foreigner directly instead of speaking Spanish and sometimes English.One of the worst movie I have ever seen.It is like first you ate an omlette, then ate waffle, then fish and chips, then baked alaska, then pizza and puked all of them.",

         "If we made a musical about 9/11 in Latin America, would it go so far in Hollywood?My rating goes beyond the acting performance, it has to do with a terrible script, a superficial and half-baked message and poor execution.For Latinos, it is a clear example of how disconnected Hollywood is not only from problems outside of them but also from the cultures that surround them. I mean, most of the movie takes place in Mexico City but it all feels like a caricature, not like it was done on purpose but it all feels caricatured due to a vast lack of knowledge of the city that was obviously had when making the movie . Ive never been to Mexico City and it still took me 5 seconds to realize that and again, the fact that it wasnt obvious to Hollywood is something that should worry them.The musical numbers feel strange and out of place, the conversations are not very fluid, they seem written by AI and the terrible Spanish makes it impossible to watch the film as a Latin American.I pirated the movie to watch it and I still want my money back.",

         "In 2024, we witnessed two of the worst movies of the year: Madame Web and Joker 2. Just when we thought nothing could be worse, Emilia Perez came along.This film was intended to showcase Mexican actresses and be filmed in Mexico, yet none of that is evident throughout the movie. The director did not take the time to research the country he aimed to portray.As a musical, it falls flat; the music is quite mediocre-almost as if it were generated by ChatGPT-and the performances are largely disappointing, except Zoe Saldañas.This movie serves as a glaring example of how a film can insult the entire Latin American continent through its portrayal of our culture.It is incomprehensible how this film received 13 Oscar nominations.",

         "Hold her. Protect her.Me encanta la película.To say that I was sceptical of this movie would be an understatement. On paper, it shouldnt work, but never have I been gladder to be wrong. Fortunately, the film exceeded my expectations. Watching this movie is equivalent to getting a dose of heroin injected into your veins. The film blends in various genres at once and not only succeeds at it but outright knocks it out of the park and surpasses my lukewarm expectations. It starts off as a procedural drama and musical, then seamlessly transitions into a family drama, crime comedy, and thriller. The director doubles down and explores all these genres to their full extent. The film also suggests that it is kind of a gangster epos, telling the story of a cartel boss on a journey of self-discovery. Ever since he was a child, he dreamt of being someone else. It is strange to me that these kinds of people have those aspirations. I always think they lack empathy and are not very progressive. This might be quite narrow-minded of me to say and might land me in hot water with some people, but its what I believe and what I experienced. If that makes me out of touch, then so be it. Im not really involved with those kinds of people, but Im glad I was exposed to this otherworldly world. On a happier note, Selena Gomez is phenomenal and radiates beauty in this film.Selena Gomez has always been a terrific actress, but this movie takes it to a whole other level. Im a simple guy. If I see Selena Gomez singing and dancing in Spanish, it is an automatic five stars. She has never looked more beautiful. Its true what they say: you become more beautiful as you age. Ill always be a fan of Selena Gomez, no matter what. If her character in the movie wants to brutally torture her very close friend , then thats her pejorative.I cant wait to download the films soundtrack so I can listen to it on repeat. Im the kind of person who listens and obsesses over a song for months on end. The film can get quite dark at times, but the doom and gloom aspects are balanced out by the incredible and wholesome musical moments. The musical moments were without a doubt magnificent and flawlessly executed. The viewer is completely immersed in the diegetic world thanks to the thrilling and catchy songs.The ending is, to put it simply, heartbreaking. I never expected a happy ending, but I thought Emilias life would continue. Emilia/Manitas wanted to spare Jessi from the pain of their transgender operation. But I think they underestimated her, as is evident throughout the film, especially the unfortunate and tragic ending. The film really captures the transgender experience realistically. One might decree that the film is a clever commentary on transgender identity and how it impacts all the facets of their life.In a nutshell, the film is an adrenaline-fuelled spectacle with action, humour, suspense, thrills, and, not to forget, song and dance. It was difficult to ascertain the mood of the audience , but I think that most people enjoyed it like me. Its certainly a divisive film. Emilia Perez is the wackiest, surrealist, intoxicating original musical of the decade so far. It had everything you could possibly want from a film, making for a super fun and memorable cinema-going experience.Final verdict: 10/10The film kind of reminded me of this quote from Donald Trump: Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison. This is a radical left liberal that would do this.",

At one point during the film, I found myself wondering if it was so groundbreaking that I simply couldnt understand it.Its not just the much-discussed poor representation of Mexico, or the terrible Spanish spoken by most of the cast, or even the horrendous songs. The real problem is that the plot makes absolutely no sense. The movie touches on several themes but fails to explore any of them in depth. It feels as if they cut all the scenes that might have given the story some coherence or emotional weight, making it impossible to connect with or care about the characters.I honestly would love to know if the actors and production team genuinely liked the final result, because its still hard for me to believe that anyone could see this as a good movie.

         "Emilia Pérez has sparked significant controversy, and for good reason. From the outset, the lack of Mexican representation like a glaring oversight. The French directors admission that he didnt feel the need to research Mexico, paired with the casting directors claim that no talented Mexican actors could be found, only adds insult to injury. These choices reflect a tone-deaf and dismissive approach to authenticity.Whats even more baffling is how Emilia Pérez managed to garner so many Oscar nominations. While the Academy has a history of nominating films with problematic undertones , those at least offered stories that entertained broad audiences. Emilia Pérez, however, doesnt even accomplish that. The story is dull and lifeless, so much so that out of three of us who watched it, two fell asleep, and the third decided to switch to another movie.To make matters worse, Emilia Pérez is a musical - but not in a good way. The songs are forgettable at best and cringe-worthy at worst, and most of the cast can barely sing. The musical numbers, which should have been a highlight, drag the movie down even further.That said, there are a couple of redeeming elements. Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón deliver strong performances and truly dont deserve the backlash tied to the films broader issues. Their nominations are the only ones that feel genuinely earned. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a mess.Overall, Emilia Pérez is an underwhelming, uninspired production that fails to justify the attention its received.",

Emilia, in particular, transforms into an overwhelmingly positive character, even though we know from the backstory that she wasnt always so good.The movie tackles a wide range of themes but struggles to fully explore them. Instead of diving deeply into any one idea, it spreads itself too thin, leaving several threads underdeveloped.As someone who doesnt typically enjoy musicals, this film didnt change my mind. However, I can appreciate that this was the directors vision, and I know many viewers will enjoy the musical elements. To its credit, some of the musical numbers were well done, especially those performed by Zoe Saldana. Her performance was a standout and arguably the films biggest revelation, elevating many scenes with her presence and talent.Overall, Emilia Perez is an enjoyable film.

         "Emilia Pérez is a musical that has sparked debate due to its themes and execution, particularly in Mexico, where its release has been surrounded by controversy. I watched it with an open mind, aware of its narrative, focus, and genre. However, I came away with mixed feelings, which I will break down into three key points: stereotypes, performances, and the script along with the songs.1. Stereotypes: Its impossible to discuss this movie without addressing its cultural treatment. From the very beginning, it feels more like a collection of clichés about Mexico than a genuine exploration of its culture. As a Mexican, Im not offended by stereotypes per se, but here, there seems to be no interest in delving deeper. It feels like a brainstorm of references-sombreros, skulls, and tequila-without adding anything meaningful to the narrative. This lack of authenticity turns the setting into a caricature. The production could have set the story in any other country, swapped these clichés for others, and it wouldnt have made much difference to the plot.2. Performances: Its interesting that the performances have been nominated for multiple awards. However, as a Spanish speaker, the accent and diction were constant distractions. The actresses seem to be trying hard, but the result fails to convey genuine emotions or connect with the audience. A crucial part of acting is mastering dialogue delivery, intonation, and how these elements evoke empathy or rejection toward the characters. This doesnt happen here. No character made me feel their story-I didnt suffer with them or celebrate their victories.3. Script and songs: The script, unfortunately, is one of the films weakest points. The dialogues feel as though they were mechanically translated into Spanish, riddled with errors in conjugation and awkward phrases. This extends to the songs, which fail to work as either music or narrative tools. In a good musical, the songs should integrate organically and move the story forward, but here, they feel forced, as if they were shoehorned into a pre-existing structure without concern for rhythm or coherence.4. The theme: The film touches on a sensitive nerve for Mexicans. Its complicated to humanize drug cartels in a country that suffers the direct consequences of violence, disappearances, and daily fear. The idea of portraying a drug lord as someone deserving of redemption, who wishes to transition to stay true to their identity and even becomes a benefactor of social causes, can feel insulting. For a foreign audience, it might be an interesting narrative, but for those living in the reality of drug-related violence, this idealization borders on indifference toward collective suffering.In conclusion, Emilia Pérez has some interesting technical elements and isolated moments worth noting, but as a whole, its not an enjoyable film. The lack of authenticity in its cultural representation, performances that fail to connect, and a weak script weigh it down too much. That said, cinema is subjective, and if this movie finds its audience, good for it. But for me, rather than being a captivating musical, it was a frustrating experience.",

The first two are played by Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofia Gascón, the second two by Selena Gomez and Adriana Paz. This quartet shared the Best Actress award at Cannes 2024. They deserved it. Saldaña in particular is a revelation.Of writer-director Jacques Audiards previous films, Ive seen four , each memorable in their different ways. None of them prepared me for this one, so hats of to him for not getting stuck in a genre rut.Theres a lot of story and a lot of singing in Emilia Pérez. When the singing is paired with Damien Jalets incisive choreography, the effect is thrilling. Otherwise, the songs drag the movie down. They are musical-theatre lite, dont dig deep, so are not up to the dramatic demands put upon them. Theyre at their best in the rap-inclined numbers, where rhythm is the most important element.The moral of Emilia Pérez seems to be that we can never slough off the past, change who we are or what we want. Its a strangely bleak vision to present in a musical.",

         "Came to write this after seeing its gala screening at the London film festival.A wild, insane roller coaster of a film that mixes crime, comedy, musical and thriller all into one and succeeds with flying colours!The four actresses at the core are the strength and they were directed to perfection by Audiard.Karla plays her character pre transition and post as it comes to her naturally, having underdone it publicly as an actor. Its a powerhouse performance that is so of our time. Im proud to be alive in a time when a trans actress plays a trans role. And not only that, she nails it. The tragedy of leaving a life but the promise of the one shes always needed.Zoe gets to sing, dance, cry and laugh and everything which I think an actor dreams of doing, let alone in one film. I had never seen a film of hers before and I am so happy this was my first because she shines! Theres a scene of her in a car, where realising what has just transpired, she breaks down in hysteria. Think Margo in I, Tonya or Glenn in Dangerous Liasons. That scene alone should win her an Academy award. And she has a beautiful voice!Selena, for whom I was most excited to see this film, kicks it out of the ballpark. Playing a mob wife, that icy, storm-simmering-below-the-surface kind of woman which she needs to revisit IMO because as a young girl who endured intense scrutiny and then went through a psychosis, she knows it too well whats it like to keep a lid on too long. The one time during the screening where I felt I was having an out of body experience is where her character Jessi finally unleashes her emotions onto us the audience after years of being oppressed. The agony and anger is heard in her voice. Its evidence of why she has said acting is her true calling and how passionate she is about it. It would be stupid to still think shes a disney kid and still has something to prove. Her acting journey is truly so exciting as a fan of almost 2 decades.Lastly, Adrianas character is like the sunshine in the otherwise dark and twisted world the film lives in. She is poignant! And it perfectly complements the other 3 actresses work. She brings love and softness to the story through her work.One major thing to note is that this film is like an opera. It reminds one of the Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which was also almost entirely sung. Emotionally its definitely intense like one, with small moments of calm when you realise youre watching a film.The cinematography was brilliant. At the end of the film, selenas character lays almost unconscious on the passenger seat as her lover drives in rage. The way the camera pans across the car to her face... it felt like a painting, very poetic but tragic.So glad to have watched it before its netflix release. Its amazing when a film can make you feel like this. To take you out of your normal and drive you a bit crazy.",

         "Its a musical trans crime drama set in modern times in Mexico, Bangkok, Tel Aviv, Switzerland, and London, England. The two main characters are a Mexican lawyer, Rita Mora Castro , and a vicious cartel drug lord, Juan Manitas . Manitas has a wife, Jessi , and two children. After the film demonstrates Ritas legal capabilities, Manitas hires her to perform a service--find a surgeon willing to perform gender-affirming surgery secretly. Rita is also to resettle his family in Switzerland while Manitas fakes his death and becomes Emelia Pérez.Four years later, Emelia wants her children to live with her as their aunt in Mexico. Rita is again enlisted to assist with things. The film follows this initially successful transition that begins to sour as Jessi pursues a relationship with Gustavo and Emelia explores a relationship with Epifanía . It ends badly.With that plot, its hard to see musical numbers sustaining it. They mostly dont, except for one riveting dance number at a fundraising dinner by Zoe Saldana. The cinematography is occasionally stunning, but the plot jumps from scene to scene with many unresolved issues, e.g., why did the shootout end, and how did Emelia continue to function safely with drug lords after her transition? Jacques Audiard tried to do too much, and it didnt succeed.Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofia Gascón do very well; the direction is the issue.",

You never know what to expect next with him, and certainly not a Spanish-language musical set in Mexico and featuring a trans mob boss.Its also interesting to see how the movie does not so much deal with transsexuality or identity but rather use that story as a starting point to ask whether people can change. Whether a criminal rotten to his/her core can become another person, and whether they can truly ever atone for their crimes. Beyond sex and gender, can you change your soul?That being said, the movie ultimately disappoints by leaving that theme aside in its last act, for the benefit of a rather bland kidnapping storyline. You feel like that our master criminal is sliding back toward their old violent habits... until the story drops the ball and goes in a disappointing direction. I was really looking forward to the resolution, a sign that the film was working for me, until I realized there was nothing more to expect from this movie. What a waste.The plot also sacrifices the Zoe Saldana character, who at first appears to be the protagonist, until she fades aways in the background.

Watching the film, I was often thinking about whats rubbed people the wrong way, and different things that rubbed different people the wrong way. Lots of it can be interpreted charitably or cynically. Even then, how much of it is really supposed to be cynical is up to interpretation.But its already an overwhelming movie to think about, so I want to focus on what I personally liked and disliked. Im not going to passionately defend the film, but Im also not going to tear it to pieces.I thought it was an interesting film, I appreciated its boldness, I thought some of the acting was good , and some of its thrilling to watch. Its a movie that only sometimes comes alive, but I liked the energy in those scenes that did work. Its a movie that does a lot and asks questions in a way that obviously some people will respond well to and some people will lash out against. I think the film wants to be challenging.Still, even with that intent, Emilia Perez does sometimes feel confused in ways that might not be intentional. Some songs are clunky and repetitive, the editing is bad at times, and the narrative doesnt flow well. All three characters often feel like theyre off doing their own thing in their own movies, and jumping between each one sometimes felt head-scratching.It feels like a film where the people behind it wanted to do a lot, but mightve been overconfident, or more lost than they realised/wanted to admit. Its an imperfect shock not to the system, but to so many systems, and I dont know how many systems/things it was targeting necessarily.Thinking about this film wears me out , but I think for better or worse, itll kind of stick with me.

Its a movie that only sometimes comes alive, but I liked the energy in those scenes that did work. Its a movie that does a lot and asks questions in a way that obviously some people will respond well to and some people will lash out against. I think the film wants to be challenging.Still, even with that intent, Emilia Perez does sometimes feel confused in ways that might not be intentional. Some songs are clunky and repetitive, the editing is bad at times, and the narrative doesnt flow well. All three characters often feel like theyre off doing their own thing in their own movies, and jumping between each one sometimes felt head-scratching.It feels like a film where the people behind it wanted to do a lot, but mightve been overconfident, or more lost than they realised/wanted to admit. Its an imperfect shock not to the system, but to so many systems, and I dont know how many systems/things it was targeting necessarily.Thinking about this film wears me out , but I think for better or worse, itll kind of stick with me. I dont know if I want it to for too long. But I can say this: I dont think I regret watching it."

Manitas has an interesting request and one that Rita entertains at her peril. For staging his murder, secretly obtaining the perfect surgeon, and providing for his family, Manitas will make Rita rich. The trick is that he will be reborn as she; Emilia. Things go well for a time, but the past begins to creep back. Emilia misses her kids and wife, and doesnt like the new influences on their lives. Emilia struggles to live half in one life, and half in another.This combined narco-thriller, musical, romance, comedy, character-driven social piece, and gender affirmation drama is mind-blowing. The film bumps around to different and interesting locations around the world too. While the film has many plot twists, director Jacques Audiard maintains firm control of the narrative. I really admire and appreciate his work. It is amazing that a film can be so thrilling and funny, and yet manage to get in a plug about the 100,000 plus people who have disappeared in Mexico due to drug violence, but Audiard does it.True to the films multi-faceted and surprising nature, the actors won a combined award at the Cannes film festival for their roles .The film is intriguing and fascinating because it never loses sight of the human nature component. Emilias feelings are natural for what someone in her shoes might ask and wonder about. For example, was she really in love and did people love her? Further, I am enthralled with the French style, particularly its rawness. No one pulls any punches, and no censors are active with their censoring.

Further, I am enthralled with the French style, particularly its rawness. No one pulls any punches, and no censors are active with their censoring. Pride, truth, forgiveness, love, and more, are all on full display."

Even the musical part i was not that fan : for me it was a lot of noise and it get pretty distracting when they revealing some part of the stories while singing . I was not a big fan of this.But for me the thing that i really enjoyed and i think the most interesting thing in that movie was that trio : Emilia , Jessi and Rita .It was very interesting because Emilia was a man before , she was the ex husband of Jessi and Rita know that .And after that it was an interesting game between all these elements : When Jessi announce she is getting married and will bring the kids with her in front of Emilia and us as a viewer we know who is Emilia and we know it will not go very well . And at the same time we know the movie will offer that confrontation between Jessi and Emilia and the truth will be revealed .I like that kind of suspense and when she knows , she knows .I love also that scene when Jessi , Rita and Emilia was on the phones and we saw how Rita tried to handle every person during the big problem between Emilia , Jessi .It have some interesting moments also all along but the beginning took some times to really give the real interest , in my opinion, in that movie .I was a little bit scared at first : i was very confusing and didnt understand what that movie was really about : the trailer didnt give too much info too . But after a few moments we know whats going to happen and it generate suspense and interest to the movie again but once again the musical part was not that necessary in my opinion and sometimes was too much distracting sadly.But i appreciate it anyway and found it a little bit long for what the movie is really about .So im still mixed feeling about this movie and its clearly not for everyone but i appreciate the trio Emilia, Rita, Jessi and i love the musical when it was Jessi who performed on the bed : it was very sensual .But what i love also its that we saw a lot of womens on screen and its a really good thing in my opinion and i enjoyed watching it . Despite not liking the musical part , i need to say that the visuals make it pleaseant anyway .We had also that side story about workers and bad conditions of work but it was not really that impactful in my opinion. There was also some moments where i felt also that the movie lack clearly of directions but its watchable and i think after a while when you will see what the movie is really about it will be suspensful and interesting despite a long and slow build .Good Anyway.",

Fortunately, the film exceeded my expectations. Watching this movie is equivalent to getting a dose of heroin injected into your veins. The film blends in various genres at once and not only succeeds at it but outright knocks it out of the park and surpasses my lukewarm expectations. It starts off as a procedural drama and musical, then seamlessly transitions into a family drama, crime comedy, and thriller. The director doubles down and explores all these genres to their full extent. The film also suggests that it is kind of a gangster epos, telling the story of a cartel boss on a journey of self-discovery. Ever since he was a child, he dreamt of being someone else. It is strange to me that these kinds of people have those aspirations. I always think they lack empathy and are not very progressive. This might be quite narrow-minded of me to say and might land me in hot water with some people, but its what I believe and what I experienced. If that makes me out of touch, then so be it. Im not really involved with those kinds of people, but Im glad I was exposed to this otherworldly world. On a happier note, Selena Gomez is phenomenal and radiates beauty in this film.Selena Gomez has always been a terrific actress, but this movie takes it to a whole other level. Im a simple guy. If I see Selena Gomez singing and dancing in Spanish, it is an automatic five stars. She has never looked more beautiful. Its true what they say: you become more beautiful as you age. Ill always be a fan of Selena Gomez, no matter what. If her character in the movie wants to brutally torture her very close friend , then thats her pejorative.I cant wait to download the films soundtrack so I can listen to it on repeat. Im the kind of person who listens and obsesses over a song for months on end. The film can get quite dark at times, but the doom and gloom aspects are balanced out by the incredible and wholesome musical moments. The musical moments were without a doubt magnificent and flawlessly executed. The viewer is completely immersed in the diegetic world thanks to the thrilling and catchy songs.The ending is, to put it simply, heartbreaking. I never expected a happy ending, but I thought Emilias life would continue. Emilia/Manitas wanted to spare Jessi from the pain of their transgender operation. But I think they underestimated her, as is evident throughout the film, especially the unfortunate and tragic ending. The film really captures the transgender experience realistically. One might decree that the film is a clever commentary on transgender identity and how it impacts all the facets of their life.In a nutshell, the film is an adrenaline-fuelled spectacle with action, humour, suspense, thrills, and, not to forget, song and dance. It was difficult to ascertain the mood of the audience , but I think that most people enjoyed it like me. Its certainly a divisive film. Emilia Perez is the wackiest, surrealist, intoxicating original musical of the decade so far. It had everything you could possibly want from a film, making for a super fun and memorable cinema-going experience.Final verdict: 10/10The film kind of reminded me of this quote from Donald Trump: Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.

         "a tonedeaf musical disaster emilia pérez has sparked significant controversy and for good reason from the outset the lack of mexican representation like a glaring oversight the french directors admission that he didnt feel the need to research mexico paired with the casting directors claim that no talented mexican actors could be found only adds insult to injury these choices reflect a tonedeaf and dismissive approach to authenticitywhats even more baffling is how emilia pérez managed to garner so many oscar nominations while the academy has a history of nominating films with problematic undertones  those at least offered stories that entertained broad audiences emilia pérez however doesnt even accomplish that the story is dull and lifeless so much so that out of three of us who watched it two fell asleep and the third decided to switch to another movieto make matters worse emilia pérez is a musical  but not in a good way the songs are forgettable at best and cringeworthy at worst and most of the cast can barely sing the musical numbers which should have been a highlight drag the movie down even furtherthat said there are a couple of redeeming elements zoe saldaña and karla sofía gascón deliver strong performances and truly dont deserve the backlash tied to the films broader issues their nominations are the only ones that feel genuinely earned unfortunately the rest of the film is a messoverall emilia pérez is an underwhelming uninspired production that fails to justify the attention its received",

         "hard to watch emilia pérez is a musical that has sparked debate due to its themes and execution particularly in mexico where its release has been surrounded by controversy i watched it with an open mind aware of its narrative focus and genre however i came away with mixed feelings which i will break down into three key points stereotypes performances and the script along with the songs stereotypes its impossible to discuss this movie without addressing its cultural treatment from the very beginning it feels more like a collection of clichés about mexico than a genuine exploration of its culture as a mexican im not offended by stereotypes per se but here there seems to be no interest in delving deeper it feels like a brainstorm of referencessombreros skulls and tequilawithout adding anything meaningful to the narrative this lack of authenticity turns the setting into a caricature the production could have set the story in any other country swapped these clichés for others and it wouldnt have made much difference to the plot performances its interesting that the performances have been nominated for multiple awards however as a spanish speaker the accent and diction were constant distractions the actresses seem to be trying hard but the result fails to convey genuine emotions or connect with the audience a crucial part of acting is mastering dialogue delivery intonation and how these elements evoke empathy or rejection toward the characters this doesnt happen here no character made me feel their storyi didnt suffer with them or celebrate their victories script and songs the script unfortunately is one of the films weakest points the dialogues feel as though they were mechanically translated into spanish riddled with errors in conjugation and awkward phrases this extends to the songs which fail to work as either music or narrative tools in a good musical the songs should integrate organically and move the story forward but here they feel forced as if they were shoehorned into a preexisting structure without concern for rhythm or coherence the theme the film touches on a sensitive nerve for mexicans its complicated to humanize drug cartels in a country that suffers the direct consequences of violence disappearances and daily fear the idea of portraying a drug lord as someone deserving of redemption who wishes to transition to stay true to their identity and even becomes a benefactor of social causes can feel insulting for a foreign audience it might be an interesting narrative but for those living in the reality of drugrelated violence this idealization borders on indifference toward collective sufferingin conclusion emilia pérez has some interesting technical elements and isolated moments worth noting but as a whole its not an enjoyable film the lack of authenticity in its cultural representation performances that fail to connect and a weak script weigh it down too much that said cinema is subjective and if this movie finds its audience good for it but for me rather than being a captivating musical it was a frustrating experience",
