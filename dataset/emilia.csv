,The Worst representation of Mexico's actual drug problems,"I am Mexican, and I can tell you that this movie is an awful representation of the narcotics problem in Mexico. While the story initially seemed interesting, it quickly became ridiculous. The main premise of the film is that a cruel assassin drug lord becomes a martyr after losing his penis. Additionally, Selenas acting is subpar; she cant even speak Spanish well, despite being cast as a Mexican character. None of the main actors are Mexican, and their Spanish accents come from Spain and the Caribbean, and frankly incomprehensible in Selenas case.Overall, a good idea turned into a bad movie.",5,1122,116,-0.07291666666666666,0.3708333333333334
,A Tone-Deaf Musical Disaster,"Emilia Pérez has sparked significant controversy, and for good reason. From the outset, the lack of Mexican representation like a glaring oversight. The French directors admission that he didnt feel the need to research Mexico, paired with the casting directors claim that no talented Mexican actors could be found, only adds insult to injury. These choices reflect a tone-deaf and dismissive approach to authenticity.Whats even more baffling is how Emilia Pérez managed to garner so many Oscar nominations. While the Academy has a history of nominating films with problematic undertones , those at least offered stories that entertained broad audiences. Emilia Pérez, however, doesnt even accomplish that. The story is dull and lifeless, so much so that out of three of us who watched it, two fell asleep, and the third decided to switch to another movie.To make matters worse, Emilia Pérez is a musical - but not in a good way. The songs are forgettable at best and cringe-worthy at worst, and most of the cast can barely sing. The musical numbers, which should have been a highlight, drag the movie down even further.That said, there are a couple of redeeming elements. Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón deliver strong performances and truly dont deserve the backlash tied to the films broader issues. Their nominations are the only ones that feel genuinely earned. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a mess.Overall, Emilia Pérez is an underwhelming, uninspired production that fails to justify the attention its received.",4,20,2,0.04136284722222221,0.46189236111111115
,"okay, so","The problem with this movie is not Selenas Spanish, I dont find this movie particularly bad but some of the dialogue is really cringy and as a Mexican none of the people from here use the terms that were in the movie. The portrayal of Mexico in this film is very stereotypical and sometimes that isnt bad, but I think they should had cast real Latin writers and supervisors to make this movie more accurate and respectful to the country. The fact that the director doesnt speak Spanish or even English speaks volumes of the commitment to understanding what the movie is about and the emotions that triggers.Also the songs are horrible.The only thing salvageable is Zoe Saldañas performance.",6,383,104,-0.019230769230769197,0.43589743589743585
,Not Worth Your Time,"I will start out by saying I am not a fan of operas. However this film was not what I had expected. The main characters were mostly unlikable. The plot was rather ridiculous. Certain actors were very miscast. Selena Gomez needed Spanish lessons. I am sure that anyone who lives in Mexico will hate this movie. The director isnt Mexican. I saw all the awards at the Golden Globes and that is the ony reason I decided to watch it. If you like any of the actors, you may want to give it a try. However I would have to say watch at your own risk. It is one of the worst films I have seen in the recent past.",,636,69,-0.00015873015873015816,0.5262433862433862
,"Emilia Perez: Ambitious Themes, Incomplete Execution","Emilia Perez isnt a bad movie, but it felt somewhat flat. At times, the story seemed too easy for the characters, lacking tension or conflict. Emilia, in particular, transforms into an overwhelmingly positive character, even though we know from the backstory that she wasnt always so good.The movie tackles a wide range of themes but struggles to fully explore them. Instead of diving deeply into any one idea, it spreads itself too thin, leaving several threads underdeveloped.As someone who doesnt typically enjoy musicals, this film didnt change my mind. However, I can appreciate that this was the directors vision, and I know many viewers will enjoy the musical elements. To its credit, some of the musical numbers were well done, especially those performed by Zoe Saldana. Her performance was a standout and arguably the films biggest revelation, elevating many scenes with her presence and talent.Overall, Emilia Perez is an enjoyable film. While I dont quite understand its acclaim at Cannes, it has its moments.",6,186,128,0.11189839572192514,0.45610516934046347
,No way this got 13 oscar nominations.,"Sorry, Ive got to say it. EMILIA PEREZ IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE. Its not a Razzie film by any stretch, but its practically incoherent narrative flow, at times excruciating dialog and lack of internal logic leave it as a mediocre straight-to Netflix commoner in the movie space. Ill give you an example of its bad script, in the movie the characther says Bienvenido which means Welcome, but in the context of the conversation she means to say Your Welcome, De nada in Spanish. It seems they did the writing in French and use google for translation. Yes, it covers some important themes and issues, but that doesnt make your movie good. You still have to build a fundamentally good film around the issues or its just noise. And thats Emilia Perez... just noise.",3,721,42,0.046428571428571465,0.6023809523809524
,Overhyped!,"Emilia Pérez is, at best, just okay. It feels incredibly overhyped, and I honestly dont understand how its winning so many awards. Zoe Saldana delivers a strong performance, but the rest of the cast is just average.The film tries to mix crime, drama, and musical elements, but the execution is uneven. Some scenes drag, making the pacing feel sluggish, and the emotional moments often seem forced rather than genuine. While the cinematography and production design are impressive, the storytelling lacks depth. Its a film that aims high but doesnt fully deliver. A 6/10 for me-decent but forgettable.",6,59,38,0.28196078431372557,0.5084803921568628
,Hard to watch,"Emilia Pérez is a musical that has sparked debate due to its themes and execution, particularly in Mexico, where its release has been surrounded by controversy. I watched it with an open mind, aware of its narrative, focus, and genre. However, I came away with mixed feelings, which I will break down into three key points: stereotypes, performances, and the script along with the songs.1. Stereotypes: Its impossible to discuss this movie without addressing its cultural treatment. From the very beginning, it feels more like a collection of clichés about Mexico than a genuine exploration of its culture. As a Mexican, Im not offended by stereotypes per se, but here, there seems to be no interest in delving deeper. It feels like a brainstorm of references-sombreros, skulls, and tequila-without adding anything meaningful to the narrative. This lack of authenticity turns the setting into a caricature. The production could have set the story in any other country, swapped these clichés for others, and it wouldnt have made much difference to the plot.2. Performances: Its interesting that the performances have been nominated for multiple awards. However, as a Spanish speaker, the accent and diction were constant distractions. The actresses seem to be trying hard, but the result fails to convey genuine emotions or connect with the audience. A crucial part of acting is mastering dialogue delivery, intonation, and how these elements evoke empathy or rejection toward the characters. This doesnt happen here. No character made me feel their story-I didnt suffer with them or celebrate their victories.3. Script and songs: The script, unfortunately, is one of the films weakest points. The dialogues feel as though they were mechanically translated into Spanish, riddled with errors in conjugation and awkward phrases. This extends to the songs, which fail to work as either music or narrative tools. In a good musical, the songs should integrate organically and move the story forward, but here, they feel forced, as if they were shoehorned into a pre-existing structure without concern for rhythm or coherence.4. The theme: The film touches on a sensitive nerve for Mexicans. Its complicated to humanize drug cartels in a country that suffers the direct consequences of violence, disappearances, and daily fear. The idea of portraying a drug lord as someone deserving of redemption, who wishes to transition to stay true to their identity and even becomes a benefactor of social causes, can feel insulting. For a foreign audience, it might be an interesting narrative, but for those living in the reality of drug-related violence, this idealization borders on indifference toward collective suffering.In conclusion, Emilia Pérez has some interesting technical elements and isolated moments worth noting, but as a whole, its not an enjoyable film. The lack of authenticity in its cultural representation, performances that fail to connect, and a weak script weigh it down too much. That said, cinema is subjective, and if this movie finds its audience, good for it. But for me, rather than being a captivating musical, it was a frustrating experience.",1,1017,65,0.020354406130268204,0.42418582375478925
,"Fine, but there are two big problems with this","This is an ambitious film that certainly succeeds in combining several genres. It is also a film that manages to fascinate and captivate for its whole, long running time.However, there are two major problems: First: the film is ridiculously moralistic.Second: it is absurd to believe that nobody would immediately question the identity and therefore the background of the main character. Her motivation is legit, she wants to make amends, but it is mindboggling that the filmmakers apparently thought it could go unquestioned when the protagonist, a mysterious woman in every respect, carelessly decides to enter the spotlight.",6,150,120,0.035416666666666666,0.5119047619047619
,WINNING AWARDS DON'T MAKE A FILM GREAT!,"Stupid film with stupid sentiment. Lot of the musicals doesnt fit and make sense at all. Felt forced kinda like Joker 2. Why was Rita selected, how she managed to do so many illegal stuff like an expert just with money, nohing explained! Can a lawyer do all of these? Anyways, I couldnt find any fault jn Gustavo. He didnt even know that Emilia was Manitas before his death! And after all that Emilia did, are we supposed to feel sorry for her? She was a cartel leader, did lots of bad stuff and at the end also did bad stuff forcing his children to stay with him without explaining anything to his wife! I feel bad for the kids. Their father ruined the whole family by running after his personal gains only. He never thought of anyone else but himself.And why is Rita always with them? I mean does she have no family or close ones? Rita and Emilia did lots of illegal stuff to get rich and the film tried to justify it by sentiment and emotion. And people are praising them for the NGO whereas they themselves are twisted. The song where Rita mocks the corrupt people also doesnt make sense as she herself did illegal stuffs to get rich!Some of the visuals are good and thats why Ive rated it higher, otherwise this is garbage.",2,145,5,-0.2544642857142857,0.6589285714285714
,Too many cooks in the kitchen,"Just finished watching Emilia Perez and it was fine I guess. There is a lot to like and dislike in this movie.Positives for Emilia Perez : The movie looks good with some great cinematography. The movie does get ambitious with the blending of genre thrown into the mix and I appreciate that. The performances from Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofia Gascon are very good. The musical numbers are fun to watch. And finally, I thought that the movie did a great job at telling its transgender story.Mixed for Emilia Perez : While the movie is certainly ambitious with its blending of genres, there are elements to this that felt out of place in this movie. The musical numbers feel like they just came out of nowhere and it felt jarring at times.Negatives for Emilia Perez : The movie is way too long and I feel that this movie couldve told its story with a shorter runtime. The movie lost my interest almost immediately and it just became background noise for me.Overall, I admired the filmmakers and actors for being ambitious with this movie, it just fully worked for me. However, I would still recommend this movie to people, if they are interested with this movie.",6,76,123,0.34833333333333333,0.5521428571428572
,Is this a joke?,"As a Spanish native speaker i found this movie disrespectful and childish. The spanish speakers characters can barely pronounce two words, turning the whole script into an uncomfortable caricature. Although disguised as a modern production, they fall into the same errors of typecast Latinos into same old stereotypes. The only valuable thing is the attempt to offer something different by mixing a Spanish language film with a musical, however its execution becomes irritating to watch. Im sure any positive reviews must come from someone totally unfamiliar with the Spanish language, as this is a determining factor in making this film totally inedible and a endless meme material.",1,851,59,0.0024891774891774867,0.43496873496873495
,Save your time and money.,"The hard truth about this movie is that people who have visited Mexico keep coming only to Cabo and Cancun where drugs, alcohol and sex are still a thing; instead of educating themselves and visiting Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, or Puebla.

,The movie has a lack of focus,"I think the film juggles too many themes, and none of them are fully explored, leaving the narrative feeling rushed and incomplete. And as a result, it feels like a collection of ideas rather than a cohesive story.I also didnt quite understand why it was framed as a musical-this choice felt disconnected from the rest of the story.The performances are solid, but the characters arent developed enough to create a lasting emotional connection.However, I really liked the cinematography, beautifully shot and visually captivating.To sum up, the movie leaves you wanting more depth and clarity.",6,39,74,0.255,0.43499999999999994
,I can't believe this has 13 Oscar nominees,"This movie is considered one of the best motion pictures of the past year? How? What a miserable experience. Why is this movie a musical? WHY? None of the songs do anything to advance the plot or tell us more about the characters, in fact the awful songwriting makes every scene with a song feel like instead of getting a deeper understanding of anything through song, the song is being used to tell us things that we can already see on screen and would be way more effectively communicated through better visual storytelling. The songs also dont really have any structure to them, they dont go anywhere. It genuinely feels like it was translated by Duolingo and the awful delivery of the lines doesnt help matters at all. Karla Gascón is fine...but not that fine to be nominated for an Oscar.",1,600,45,0.06190476190476192,0.5035714285714286
,Strangely bleak,"Enjoyable enough movie with two demanding leading roles and two supporting roles requiring excellent performers. The first two are played by Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofia Gascón, the second two by Selena Gomez and Adriana Paz. This quartet shared the Best Actress award at Cannes 2024. They deserved it. Saldaña in particular is a revelation.Of writer-director Jacques Audiards previous films, Ive seen four , each memorable in their different ways. None of them prepared me for this one, so hats of to him for not getting stuck in a genre rut.Theres a lot of story and a lot of singing in Emilia Pérez. When the singing is paired with Damien Jalets incisive choreography, the effect is thrilling. Otherwise, the songs drag the movie down. They are musical-theatre lite, dont dig deep, so are not up to the dramatic demands put upon them. Theyre at their best in the rap-inclined numbers, where rhythm is the most important element.The moral of Emilia Pérez seems to be that we can never slough off the past, change who we are or what we want. Its a strangely bleak vision to present in a musical.",6,66,141,0.15462962962962967,0.4476273148148148
,It's a caricature,"I am speechless... Im guessing all the positive reviews are from people who a) dont speak Spanish and b) wanted their caricatures of Mexicans and trans people confirmed.The dialogues are insufferable, no one speaks like that, the music is jarring, the accents are not good.The bad words sprinkled thought the movie feel so unnatural, not only because of the delivery, but how they are used. This was clearly written by somebody with some vague knowledge of Mexican culture, but definitely not enough to make something good.The only redeeming quality this movie has is that its undoubtedly pretty.

,Felt like a fever dream,"A musical about a cartel leader undergoing a transition into a female social activist was not on my Oscars bingo card. I am a bit confused on how it snagged a leading 13 Oscar nominations. I really wanted to like it but it felt all over the place, the story felt off somehow... not satisfying i suppose. The movie being a musical seemed really random and the songs were not that great. I dont want to be super negative because it did have some good moments with the acting, costumes/makeup, and some of the choreography. Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofia Gascón put on a great performance and I think that they are deserving of some recognition but I still cant get over the 13 nominations.",6,16,37,0.13444444444444445,0.44000000000000006
,Everything but mexican,"Only money is capable of making someone consider this film a good representation of history, culture or anything, on its own or considering the Mexican context. The number of nominations and awards only demonstrates this, that the outpouring of money moves the vote. The Mexican majority itself finds the film disrespectful. A French director who thinks he knows enough about Mexican culture, an international cast with a Mexican actress who isnt even being considered in the awards campaign. Its simply bizarre and frightening that the film industry and academia genuinely consider this work.",1,552,49,0.11999999999999998,0.44
,one word : flabbergasted,"Came to write this after seeing its gala screening at the London film festival.A wild, insane roller coaster of a film that mixes crime, comedy, musical and thriller all into one and succeeds with flying colours!The four actresses at the core are the strength and they were directed to perfection by Audiard.Karla plays her character pre transition and post as it comes to her naturally, having underdone it publicly as an actor. Its a powerhouse performance that is so of our time. Im proud to be alive in a time when a trans actress plays a trans role. And not only that, she nails it. The tragedy of leaving a life but the promise of the one shes always needed.Zoe gets to sing, dance, cry and laugh and everything which I think an actor dreams of doing, let alone in one film. I had never seen a film of hers before and I am so happy this was my first because she shines! Theres a scene of her in a car, where realising what has just transpired, she breaks down in hysteria. Think Margo in I, Tonya or Glenn in Dangerous Liasons. That scene alone should win her an Academy award. And she has a beautiful voice!Selena, for whom I was most excited to see this film, kicks it out of the ballpark. Playing a mob wife, that icy, storm-simmering-below-the-surface kind of woman which she needs to revisit IMO because as a young girl who endured intense scrutiny and then went through a psychosis, she knows it too well whats it like to keep a lid on too long. The one time during the screening where I felt I was having an out of body experience is where her character Jessi finally unleashes her emotions onto us the audience after years of being oppressed. The agony and anger is heard in her voice. Its evidence of why she has said acting is her true calling and how passionate she is about it. It would be stupid to still think shes a disney kid and still has something to prove. Her acting journey is truly so exciting as a fan of almost 2 decades.Lastly, Adrianas character is like the sunshine in the otherwise dark and twisted world the film lives in. She is poignant! And it perfectly complements the other 3 actresses work. She brings love and softness to the story through her work.One major thing to note is that this film is like an opera. It reminds one of the Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which was also almost entirely sung. Emotionally its definitely intense like one, with small moments of calm when you realise youre watching a film.The cinematography was brilliant. At the end of the film, selenas character lays almost unconscious on the passenger seat as her lover drives in rage. The way the camera pans across the car to her face... it felt like a painting, very poetic but tragic.So glad to have watched it before its netflix release. Its amazing when a film can make you feel like this. To take you out of your normal and drive you a bit crazy.",9,153,840,0.14095804988662133,0.6155895691609976
,Jacques Audiard tried to do too much,"Its a musical trans crime drama set in modern times in Mexico, Bangkok, Tel Aviv, Switzerland, and London, England. The two main characters are a Mexican lawyer, Rita Mora Castro , and a vicious cartel drug lord, Juan Manitas . Manitas has a wife, Jessi , and two children. After the film demonstrates Ritas legal capabilities, Manitas hires her to perform a service--find a surgeon willing to perform gender-affirming surgery secretly. Rita is also to resettle his family in Switzerland while Manitas fakes his death and becomes Emelia Pérez.Four years later, Emelia wants her children to live with her as their aunt in Mexico. Rita is again enlisted to assist with things. The film follows this initially successful transition that begins to sour as Jessi pursues a relationship with Gustavo and Emelia explores a relationship with Epifanía . It ends badly.With that plot, its hard to see musical numbers sustaining it. They mostly dont, except for one riveting dance number at a fundraising dinner by Zoe Saldana. The cinematography is occasionally stunning, but the plot jumps from scene to scene with many unresolved issues, e.g., why did the shootout end, and how did Emelia continue to function safely with drug lords after her transition? Jacques Audiard tried to do too much, and it didnt succeed.Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofia Gascón do very well; the direction is the issue.",6,26,83,0.13460743801652894,0.43068181818181817

The Spanish dialogue? Completely unintelligible, thanks to ridiculous accents and what seemed like Google Translate-level writing. Seriously, who thought this was acceptable?The story might have had some potential, but even that was destroyed by how horribly written it was. Any shred of creativity was drowned in a sea of incompetence. This isnt just a bad movie; its an insult to anyone who appreciates decent filmmaking.

,Doesn't live up to its first act,"I really enjoy how director Jacques Audiard can embrace genre films, something that stands out in French filmmaking. You never know what to expect next with him, and certainly not a Spanish-language musical set in Mexico and featuring a trans mob boss.Its also interesting to see how the movie does not so much deal with transsexuality or identity but rather use that story as a starting point to ask whether people can change. Whether a criminal rotten to his/her core can become another person, and whether they can truly ever atone for their crimes. Beyond sex and gender, can you change your soul?That being said, the movie ultimately disappoints by leaving that theme aside in its last act, for the benefit of a rather bland kidnapping storyline. You feel like that our master criminal is sliding back toward their old violent habits... until the story drops the ball and goes in a disappointing direction. I was really looking forward to the resolution, a sign that the film was working for me, until I realized there was nothing more to expect from this movie. What a waste.The plot also sacrifices the Zoe Saldana character, who at first appears to be the protagonist, until she fades aways in the background.

Its as if the composers Googled Mexican music and slapped together the first five results. No soul, no nuance, just a jarring cacophony. Sorry but hasta mi pinche vulva te extraña is so cringey in spanish!And the trans representation?

,"Relentless, thrilling ride that gets rickety, but never derails","Emilia Pérez is a 2024 musical drama starring Zoe Saldana as Rita, a lawyer that is doing her job until a drug lord kidnaps her and requests for a sex change. Along the way we have Selena Gomez play Jessi, the wife of the drug lord that adjusts to new life with the kids she raised with him after the sex change she doesnt know about. Then of course we have Karla Sofía Gascón play Emilia Pérez, the drug lord that changed gender and continues building her empire.Most of the story is delivered with musical numbers so if you dont like that type of genre, stay away from it. This film in particular had a very strange effect on me after it finished as I kind of went into it blind and to be honest, thats what you should do because the film in general is very unexpected in some places and quite comedic as well. After the director and cast of the film presented it to us, then the film started and the audience spread laughs and joy to some of the aspects of the film and I appreciate that. The film shines best with its amazing cinematography , powerhouse acting from all involved and some of the musical numbers.Now, why I say some of the musical numbers, is because most of them are pretty great and impactful to the story but as the film progressed the musical numbers became a lot less eye popping then before and became cliché because of this. The musical performance at the end was dull in my opinion but I think it sumed up some of the story a little bit. But dont listen to me though, as theres a film for everybody and I genuinely liked some of the elements of this film and I think most of you will too when it comes out soon enough.Overall, while not as greatly delivered as I hoped, Emilia Pérez is still a cinematic achievement in musical numbers and great acting that really makes the film all the more engaging and fun.

,"Better than Joker 2, at least.","Its interesting coming to Emilia Perez late, after its caused the stir it has. Watching the film, I was often thinking about whats rubbed people the wrong way, and different things that rubbed different people the wrong way. Lots of it can be interpreted charitably or cynically. Even then, how much of it is really supposed to be cynical is up to interpretation.But its already an overwhelming movie to think about, so I want to focus on what I personally liked and disliked. Im not going to passionately defend the film, but Im also not going to tear it to pieces.I thought it was an interesting film, I appreciated its boldness, I thought some of the acting was good , and some of its thrilling to watch. Its a movie that only sometimes comes alive, but I liked the energy in those scenes that did work. Its a movie that does a lot and asks questions in a way that obviously some people will respond well to and some people will lash out against. I think the film wants to be challenging.Still, even with that intent, Emilia Perez does sometimes feel confused in ways that might not be intentional. Some songs are clunky and repetitive, the editing is bad at times, and the narrative doesnt flow well. All three characters often feel like theyre off doing their own thing in their own movies, and jumping between each one sometimes felt head-scratching.It feels like a film where the people behind it wanted to do a lot, but mightve been overconfident, or more lost than they realised/wanted to admit. Its an imperfect shock not to the system, but to so many systems, and I dont know how many systems/things it was targeting necessarily.Thinking about this film wears me out , but I think for better or worse, itll kind of stick with me. I dont know if I want it to for too long. But I can say this: I dont think I regret watching it.",6,8,31,0.08888888888888889,0.6324074074074074
,Terrible & Tedious In Equal Measure,"Emelia PerezQuite frankly it was a terrible movie from start to finish with little redeeming features, what a waste of 2 hrs and 14 minutes of anyones life!The story can be summed up in very few words, a murderous Mexican Kingpin Druglord wants to escape and establish a new identity, this coincides with his desire to become a woman, and has been taking hormones for 2 years in advance in preparation for this moment, he flashes his breasts at Rita, the Lawyer to persuade her of his conviction to transition. Surprisingly a concurrent scene shows him with his wife and two children and she seems not to have noticed this additional cleavage lol!Oh well moving on, we then have a surgical interlude, 5 years pass and his widow and 2 children are relocated to Switzerland.The second half of the movie now begins with the Druglord reappearing as Emilia Perez, her new female identity, and reconnected with Rita, seemingly after 5 years he missed his children. Unbelievable!Suddenly Emilia was the Aunt, his widow and children were living with him and we had some presentation of happy families lol. Quite ridiculous!Emilia then embarked with Rita on reuniting the bodies of disappeared victims with their families, possibly victims of her past life. After various twists and turns Emilia gets killed in a botched kidnap attempt and she is elevated to that of a modern saint in the closing sequences.As you can see it was a bizarre and unbelievable tissue thin story, with numerous plot holes, populated by nasty stereotypes in the format of a Latino novella. The strange music grated, the stylised dancing was simplistic and derivative. It all moved at a glacial pace and was as dull as ditchwater and we just couldnt like or identify with any of the extreme characters. It was just a car crashing offending everyone!I am totally at a loss to understand the reviews and the ratings on here, I just wanted it to end. To give a high mark because there is a gender transition element, which, by the way is incidental to the story, because its trendy, is shocking and shallow, and equally wrong to elevate a movie because the movie is set in Mexico, a supposed unrepresented cinematic country.Any potential rating must be based upon the art product before us and this was beyond bad, Im going to give this a 3 out of 10 and that is a fair score for this tripe!",3,42,2,-0.04888306138306138,0.543053613053613
,"It is stunning, it is brave, it is...Utter nonsense.","This motion picture is one of the most celebrated and talked about films of the year 2024? And deserving of nominations and wins at some of the most prestigious events honoring excellence in the craft of filmmaking? I dont want to come across as some kind of conspiracy theorist but are the producers trying to perform every trick out of the hat to convince members of the Academy to select it for most noteworthy of award categories? Because when I think of the best of 2024, this does not even make it in the top five, let alone top 10 . I wouldnt even go far as to say it is among the worst of 2024, either, but really there isnt much going for it to give a recommendation.The film does not commit to a tone. One minute it wants to be a dark comedy, and then the next a very serious crime drama that provokes a bit of thought. The two could be balanced better if the script were given another pass, but as it is the clash creates a night and day difference and rather than come across as unique it feels like incompetence on the filmmakers part. The premise honestly could work as a comedy, and a thriller, but the lack of commitment creates a very strange experience that makes the whole thing seem so silly.The musical numbers do not add really anything to the film, are not catchy or memorable and feel very out of place when they arrive. Zoe Saldana is a good singer, but struggles to make these lyrics sound golden, Selena Gomez sings pretty good but the context to where the music comes into the picture feels forced in.Zoe Saldanas performance is good, but I dont think it is her best in her career as some outlets suggest. Selena Gomez is completely miscast. Karla Sofía Gascón and Adriana Paz are both quite good, but the script isnt up to level in quality. Edgar Ramirezs role could have easily been portrayed by anyone else, really. This isnt to say Ramirez is bad in the production, but his function seems to just be a recognizable face - far and away the best presentation of his acting talent.The representation of the drug problems in Mexico are terribly researched and portrayed wrong by the filmmakers. Was it hard to have done at least an hour of research into the topic? The presentation of transgenderism is also problematic, so changing your biological self means you are free of your past sins, really? Its saying something when organizations like GLAAD have not been very kind towards this picture.I personally do not think time will be very kind towards this movie, even if it wins all the awards at the 2025 Academy Awards.",,21,10,0.235060606060606,0.5227878787878788
,Very different and most entertaining musical I've seen in a while.,"Emilia Perez really caused a stir. Theres so much controversy around this film, and so many who absolutely love it while so many detest it. Most of the criticism seem to come from Spanish speaking people. Since I dont speak Spanish and dont know anything about Mexican culture, I obviously cant comment on that aspect of the film. Therefore I will review it on its entertainment value .Shortly after winning a murder case, attorney Rita is contacted by crime boss Manitas. Tired of a life of violence, he wants to start a new life...as a woman. He requests Rita to do research on gender-affirming surgery, and promises to reward her richly. However, Manitas is married and he has children. In order from him to become the woman he always wanted to be, his family is to be told he was killed by his enemies.Four years after his surgery, Manitas is known as Emilia Perez. Longing for his family, he once again contacts Rita to ensure their reunion, with Emilia supposedly being their Aunt. Regretting his past, Emilia is now doing good in his new life, but - when things start going wrong - old habits seem to die hard...I absolutely love this movie! I love the music, the musical segments, and the performances by Zoe Saldana as Rita and Karla Sofía Gascón as Emilia Perez. Emilia Perez is a very different kind of musical, and I thought it was fresh and original. The film captured my attention from beginning to end.",7,9,38,0.1949242424242424,0.4179696969696968

,Definitely Keeps You Hooked (Not your average musical),Interesting concept which the writers used cleverly. Its a musical so be prepared to see some songs here and there during dialogue. Its a unique story which keeps you guessing and you cant help but think whats next. Acting and casting are on point. Flow of the film in the beginning is delicately managed but later acquires a slower pace which I believe is there to engrain character development and invoke emotional appeal. I wont comment on the ending as it would give it away and kill the anticipation that was so carefully built.Its definitely not a conventional film. I would say you would be shocked from time to time but at one point you will just become immune to it especially to the eccentric characters and bold storyline.

,Truly abysmal,"I want to be clear. I agree this movie is denigrating to the Mexican community and the trans community which by itself makes it an absolute disgrace. As a movie by itself it is truly one of the biggest pieces of garbage I have ever seen. Zoe Saldana is fine, but the acting from every other person is quite frankly abhorrent. Selena Gomez is truly shocking in both her grasp of Spanish and her singing. How this movie has garnered so much critical praise is beyond me.

,"Thriller, Crime, Drama, Romance, AND MUSICAL.","Watched at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sep. 14th, 2024 Format: Regular theatreRating: 8/10Im surprised how this film is able to be so many things at the same time. Comedy, drama, action, thriller, self-exploration, AND MUSICAL. It balances each genre and gives it enough time in a way that wont make it seem too much.Each acting performance in this film is outstanding specifically Zoe Saldana in the first half of the film and Karla Sofía Gascón in the second half of the film who played two roles in this film perfectly. Unfortunately, everything related to Selena Gomez in terms of her acting performance and character needed more effort to be put in. Very weak character that was just there as a filler to make things more complicated for the main protagonist and the events of the story.Though musicals arent my thing, this film dealt with that part in such a unique way that made each song performance creative in terms of the directing and lyrics. Two songs that really grabbed my attention is one that touched on a political aspect in Mexico that had such a creative and unique direction to it. The other one really proved Zoe Saldanas performance as it was great with all of the dark and minimum lighting that it had.",8,121,692,0.11345238095238096,0.4554120879120879

That is just a big clap in the face of all people who lost someone because of the drugs wars in reality. The whole basis of this movie just feels wrong and without respect to those people.What is more bad?

Performances were excellent by all 3 leads, but its the directing of this movie was the most strongest aspect. I did enjoyed Rust and Bone some years ago even more then Emilia Pérez, but they both have similar tones and vibes.

The fact that it received nominations and awards only proves how biased and sold-out these institutions are. Dont waste your time on this movie. There are plenty of better films out there.

,What's wrong with the cinema industry? 13 Oscars nominations?,"I once heard that one of the great elements that should not be missing in a good script is emotionality, the construction of emotions and a good dose of sentimentality, so that the audience is hooked either to the characters, to the situations or to both. Of course, its an element that must be combined with several others and mixed in the right and necessary quantities so that we can have a good story to see and tell. Well, Emilia Pérez has none of that. Zero. Nothing. There is no emotional construction of any character. The audience is bombarded with very direct situations that seem to be simulating a reality that seems, from its foundation, implausible. All this is done in a serious and apparently respectful manner, but its like paying tribute to something abstract and indefinite.The performances dont help. This is the worst Selena Gomez I have ever seen. Full of melodramatic exaggerations in a niche she doesnt belong in, and making it seem like she was acting reluctantly and forcefully. Even their songs in the movie are horribly performed. None of the songs are good, in any case. The rest of the cast has very discreet performances with the exception of Zoe Saldaña, who is the best in the film, however, I dont think its enough for her to star in the awards season.I empathize with the Mexican audience who has complained about all the cultural inaccuracies. I agree with everything that has already been mentioned before. This is a story about Mexico, made by people who are not Mexican and who didnt even care to look Mexican.Regarding the gender identity part of the story, I think its a mockery. Its an extreme situation that is very difficult to believe. An attempt is made to be inclusive with a delicate topic to end up being disastrously offensive with another ultra-sensitive topic such as the victims of extreme violence due to drug trafficking and gangs. Its thus a story without a head or tail, which was attempted to be put together to purposely polemicize and nothing else. Its really a shame that such poorly planned projects are given space, perhaps leaving out much better ones.I dont want to close this review without first saying that the global film industry is very wrong if they believe that this is being inclusive, because this is a joke in very bad taste. Its a scandal that a film like this is celebrated with so many nominations and awards. Absolutely an aberration.",3,155,13,0.03133444075304543,0.5394739756367664
,Failed to commit to any of its premises,"Emilia Perez Is a drama thriller musical centred around a cartel boss and their lawyer. Whist I was somewhat invested throughout the film, my main issue is that it did not commit to any of its premises which left the experience feeling very surface level with the most memorable part being that it tried to combine several genres together.It didnt commit to being a thriller which meant there was nothing fresh regarding these elements. The plot allowed allowing anything that might have been intriguing to simply happen by chance which removed the tension from these scenes. The musical numbers werent particularly entertaining and the drama concerning the protagonist wasnt explored in a way that gave me meaningful insight into the character and their emotions. So whilst the mishmash of genres was intriguing, little else was memorable with the exception of Zoe Saldanas performance.",6,2,6,0.22369791666666666,0.4056547619047619

,One of the best movies from Cannes,"My second favorite movie from Cannes after The Substance . Its pure insanity. Musical about drug dealers and corruption in Mexico??? WTF???Emilia Perez is really inventive. It blends a lot of different genres: drama, comedy, musical, thriller, but does it in a very good and entertaining way. Its also extremely original and also suprisingly emotional. There is a character in here that has a moving and heartbreaking journey throughout the movie. Im not gonna go into details. Its not really a spoiler cause its revealed in first 15-20 minutes into the movie but I didnt knew about it and I was shocked that this movie went into that direction. Thats why advise you not to read description and to go see it fully blind if u want to have the best possible experience.The best thing about this Emilia Perez are definitely perfomances. It won Best Actress Award at Cannes for as many as 4 perfomances . Saldana plays the main character and has a lot of intense and showy scenes . Im happy that after all these blockbusters she finally got the role where she could show her acting chops. Gascon plays titular character. Its kinda supporting role but tbh shes the heart of the movie and the whole plot takes place around her. Gomez and Paz were good but Im suprised they also won the Palme - their perfomances wasnt as great and memorable as Saldanas and Gascons.Jacques Audiards vision is bold and impressive. This movie is stylish and looks beautiful. I love the cinematography and score. Not eveything works perfectly and there were a few moments where I wasnt fully sold out on this but most of the time, I was enjoying it and I was amazed by its craziness, ingenuity and originality. Im not a big fan of musicals but the musical scenes in that movie are gripping and very well choreographed shot which makes them enjoyable to watch. The songs are catchy and memorable .Emilia Perez is not for everyone. Some people were walking out, some were saying its one of the worst movies of the festival, some were loving it . General public is not gonna love this. The closest movie to this Ive saw is Annette by Leos Carax. Emilia Perez is more crowd-pleasing, but its still gonna miss with a lot of people.

,"Saldana is GREAT! The rest? ""Meh""","To say that the Spanish-language French musical crime film, EMILIA PEREZ is audacious does not do justice to the word AUDACIOUS. It is like saying that a Giant Redwood is a tree.Written and Directed by Jacques Audiard , EMILIA PEREZ tells the squalid tale of a Mexican crime druglord who decides to transition to a new life as a female - not to escape from his enemies, but to run to the person he/she felt she always has been.Oh...and did I mention it was a musical?The Grand Jury Prize winner at Cannes EMILIA PEREZ has a lot going for it starting with the audacity of the premise...and deciding to do it as a musical.The music works and sets the dark, dingy mood of the film and the characters within. However, be warned, there is no DEFYING GRAVITY in this film. The characters remain grounded in reality and the songs are dour and moody with nary a flying monkey in sight.Zoe Saldana is a well-deserved Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actress as the Lawyer that drug Kingpin Juan Manitas Del Monte hires to help with the transition. It is a career best performance by Saldana and she carries the emotional heart and soul of this film on her shoulders and she bears it well. She won the Golden Globe for her efforts here and should be considered a front-runner for the Oscar, shes that good.Its a good thing that Saldana is so strong because all of the rest of the characters are thinly written with little to no depth to them so performers like Selena Gomez and Edgar Ramirez look fairly narcissistic as they focus only on themselves and think nothing of anyone else.And, the same can be said for the title character played by Gascon. Her Manitas/Emilia Perez comes off fairly one-dimensional and all of her actions seem selfish and self-absorbed and, quite frankly, I didnt care what happens to this character through the course of the film.And that, ultimately, sinks this film as EMILIA PEREZ is, really, a two-hander between Saldanas character and Garcons character and trans-actor Garcon is just not strong enough to bring any emotional range and heft to her scenes and she is dismissed off the screen when a true movie veteran like Saldana gives a career best performance.Director/Writer Audiard helms this piece with sure-handedness, knowing exactly the type of movie he wanted to bring to the screen and his laser-sharp focus on this fever-dream of a film is aided by an unwavering vision of by filmmaker. He should be applauded - but maybe not rewarded with an Oscar - for his vision.A darling of the industry - it garnered 13 Oscar nominations - Emilia Perez, is an audacious attempt at doing something different and artsy, but mostly misses the mark .Letter Grade: B7 stars and you can take that to the Bank",7,11,79,0.18330086580086583,0.46036796536796537

Unfortunately the songs in Emilia Perez are not good. Very very not good.As everyone else has noted, its been very well shot, very colourful and some of the choreography during the unendurable song and dance numbers was pretty good.Alas this good cinematopgraphy did not help make these sequences any more enjoyable mind you. Each song and dance number causes the overall story to screech to a halt. This is super frustrating as there are moments where it seems like there could be an interesting story at play, but these are soon washed away with another super cringey and cheesy song.The story as it is about a trans woman who changes their personality completely after transitioning is insulting tom the trans community as well as being utterly ridiculous.Zoe Saldana is giving everything 110% so respect to her, I only wish the film were worthy of her efforts. Everyone else was lousy, especially Selena Gomez who with all her financial resources youd think could afford a dialect coach.Im not sure what the critics and award voters are seeing in this one.

,A Transgender Musical Drama That Hits Directly at the Heart,"The uniquely transgender perspective in this highly stylized 2024 musical melodrama directed and written by Jacques Audiard provides quite an emotional rollercoaster. The story tracks the physical and spiritual transformation of notorious drug cartel boss Manitas del Monte into the title character, a woman who eventually heads up a nonprofit to help loved ones find victims of the cartels he/she previously instigated. The irony of the situation manifests itself in strikingly dramatic ways that reminded me of the unpredictable plot twists in Pedro Almodovars films. Based on her successful record in defending guilty underworld figures, lawyer Rita Mora Castro has been recruited to not only organize the sex change operation for Manitas but a few years later, move Manitas estranged wife Jessi and their two children into Emilias house. However, things start to fall apart when Jessi decides to marry her lover Gustavo and take the children away. The Baroque nature of the story grows even more exuberant in the last half-hour, while the storytelling musical numbers provide a compelling energy quite unexpected throughout the story. Transgender star Karla Sofia Gascon seamlessly plays both Manitas and Emilia with powerful conviction. Zoe Saldana is a revelation as Rita as not only a superb character actress but as an adept singer and dancer, while Selena Gomez convincingly plays against type as the slatternly Jessi.

She talked in Spanish the whole movie, that is kind of impressive for a non spanish-speaker, and I honestly understood the part that her character is not originally from Mexico, because since the first scene she switch from Spanish to English very easily, giving us a clue that maybe she lived in the USA a long part of her life.Shes a Pocha and maybe she just moved to Mexico because of her husband, and she kept mixing a little bit of English phrases throughout the movie, to be honest it would have been better if she had done it more times throughout the movie to make that more clear, but to be fair it was maybe too much to ask.In conclusion the movie was well executed, of course the depiction of Mexico was a little bit cliche, where they show a very rural Mexico, I mean, yes, Mexico is like that but just in small towns, not in MEXICO CITY, the capital, common!Despite that the cinematography was good and the acting was decent, the premise was interesting and in general entertaining, that is why my 7/10.",7,6,40,0.22442857142857145,0.4796428571428571
,"Overrated Pretentious, Implausible Trash","It generally takes tremendous courage to stand up and proclaim that the Emperor is indeed naked, especially in the face of a crowd of willfully blind onlookers who contend otherwise. Nevertheless, there are times when this truly needs to be said in light of an inexplicably misguided view to the contrary. And thats certainly the case with the latest from often-overrated writer-director Jacques Audiard. This jumbled mess of a film cant make up its mind if it wants to be an edgy musical , a quasi-campy comedy , a crime thriller or a treatise on forgiveness and redemption that unapologetically drips with overwrought political correctness. In essence, this offering follows the exploits of Minitas , a Mexican drug cartel warlord who wants to undergo the transgender transition process to liberate the inner woman that has been inside him since birth, aided by a supposedly articulate and self-righteous lawyer who hastily and seemingly thoughtlessly sells out with the promise of a financial windfall for her assistance. After undergoing the process, however, the newly emerged Emilia Pérez has regrets about her past, both in terms of her brutal professional behavior and the abandonment of her kids and shrewish, self-centered wife . However, this change of heart, while modestly understandable, generally lacks believability. And, given the utterly reprehensible nature and baffling, head-scratchingly contradictory choices of all the principals, its difficult to fathom how anyone would care a whit about any of them. Thats especially true for the pictures lead, whose actions do little to generate any kind of meaningful empathy for transgender individuals and causes. And, through it all, the story is mystifyingly augmented with a slew of inconsistently timed, largely unremarkable musical production numbers that add precious little to the overall story . In sum, the finished product plays like a preposterously melodramatic Italian opera libretto mixed with elements from pictures like Sicario and any number of cheesy Mexican soap operas. How this cinematic morass has managed to garner as much attention as it has received is truly beyond me. Thats especially true with the many undeserved accolades it has received, including 10 Golden Globe Award nominations , as well as honors from the Critics Choice Awards, the American Film Institute, and numerous film festivals, including the prestigious events in Cannes and Toronto. Indeed, dont be fooled into thinking that the blend of diverse elements here should be taken for inventive, inspired originality. But, more importantly, dont waste your time on this celluloid trash, despite how allegedly elegant the Emperors outfits are said to be.",3,241,25,0.07025034713713958,0.49458261863922237
,"Weird yet interesting take on the tale of drug dealers, corruption, transgender identity and singing","You cant expect what Jacques Audiard offers. Audiard is a filmmaker whom always surprises me with his works as he makes stories that are interesting and very different to other movies I have seen. An concept of a musical about Mexico, drug dealers, gender identity, and corruption is very strange, and its kind of messy, yet with Audiards direction and approach, it still worked.Audiards direction, writing, and atmosphere approaches are well thought-out. The writing explores the characters journeys and its inventive style really adds a lot to the setting. Many of the characters, while they certainly arent all likable people, at the same time, you still are engaged to observe these characters and observing what they are and their purposes.With good camerawork, production, and musical score, all of the performances are great, particularly Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón as both provided outstanding performances. As a musical, the song-writing is pretty good as there are some really memorable songs that are still burned into my head. Although some of the singing and songs didnt fully work, as a piece, it offered. I do appreciate the film using the themes of transgender identity and depth blended with the musical moments pretty well!The writing is good, but I have to admit, I wasnt sold with every aspect as I found certain aspects to feel messy and a bit too melodramatic.Overall, this isnt my favorite from Jacques Audiard but one thing is for sure, this is something unique and memorable.",7,17,169,0.2868824404761905,0.5520337301587301
,Worst Movie EVER!!,"This is, hands down, the worst musical I have ever seen. If zero stars were an option, Id be all over it. Watching this was like sitting through a bad high school play where everyone forgot their lines-but somehow, they also forgot the plot.Lets talk about Selena Gomezs character, Jessi. It was like her entire script got run through Google Translate, twice. I speak Spanish, and even I needed subtitles to understand her. Honestly, it felt like the movie was actively trying to insult my brain.The plot had potential-Ill give it that-but it was buried under layers of cringe-worthy acting and a bafflingly tone-deaf approach. The director must have skipped the Mexican culture and language section during research . And dont even get me started on how wildly insensitive this movie is to families dealing with real-life disappearances.In conclusion, this movie didnt just miss the mark-it missed the entire target, fell off the stage, and took the audiences patience with it.",1,110,9,-0.08683760683760686,0.4342735042735043
,I have a lot of thoughts...,"*This review did not take the transphobic tropes, harmful stereotypes, inaccurate accents, cloned AI voices, racism from the actors, and lack of research into consideration. To focus on the film alone, I will speak only on the story and the movie on a technical level. Dont get mad at me. I didnt make this movie.*THE ACADEMY THINKS THIS WAS BETTER THAN DUNE 2????????! 13 OSCAR NOMINATIONS???😀🔫THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MUSICAL. Every time I started to become invested, a song would take me out of it. Zoe Saldaña was good. Selena Gomez was terribly miscast. And Karla Sofía Gascón was incredible, especially as Emilia but believable as both. Adriana Paz, who I believe was the only Mexican actor in the film, played Epifanía well. With that said, I did like El Mal.The first act had pacing issues and abrupt transitions but I was still hooked. I immediately felt like I knew who Rita was, but that was the result of Zoes performance more than the writing.Speaking of the writing, the second act slowed down and felt directionless. The missing people storyline came out of no where, especially since Emilia murdered many people. Also why did the movie ignore the fact that Emilia murdered many people and is still a criminal?I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the third act. The idea that you cant escape your violent past so easily, is a point I wish they tried to make more often. Great score. Great acting. Good songs . But too many unnecessary camera movements. The directing was poor and it was overall visually ugly.Not that this is an uncommon opinion, but several of the Oscars this film received were not deserved.I hope this film turns into the play it was meant to become as well, and is done properly.",8,10,37,0.14131944444444441,0.528888888888889
,Caught me off guard,"I went into this, a bit sceptical, not a big fan of modern musicals, but, also not sure what to expect. I have to say, the first few minutes, I almost turned it off, but then, Zoe Saldanha drew me in, and I found myself utterly charmed...I have loved Zoe since I saw her many years ago in Center Stage, she constantly delivered great work through the years, and I have to say I am very happy that she finally has the role that will bring her some real awards attention. She is co lead in this film, and should go lead, but I get it, in supporting she might actually get to go all the way and win the Oscar?! This is the role of het lifetime , and she is brilliant in it. There is a scene, at a benefit, and she starts to sing and dance... took my breath away.Selena Gomez, like Zoe, I have loved since her Wizards days, very happy to see her doing so well in her acting career, and she also, gives a fantastic, very mature grown up performance. She is the supporting actress here, I hope she also gets a nomination at least.This is my first time watching Karla Sofia Gascon in anything, and yes, she really delivers, stealing every scene, very raw, emotional, fierce, fiery... so many words I can use to describe her performance. I really hope she gets that nomination. I am writing this on 14.11.2024, and watching the chatter online, I do hope she makes history and can go all the way to the Kodak theatre.The camera work, the music, the story and message at the core of the film are all really interesting and will make you think. The film has a certain rhythm, a beat, at certain points I found myself tapping my feat.There are a few songs where the lyrics were a bit strange and will make some people cringe, but I think it may just me the spanish to english translation.For all movie lovers, movie buffs, awards watchers, go see the film, it really is a great one. One of my fave of the year.",6,9,78,0.2646992481203007,0.4595196324143693
,Horribly offensive to the Mexican public,"For me, being Mexican, it is very offensive, not only because Spanish is anything but Mexican, but because of the topics it deals with. It is like this if I gathered Mexican actors who do not know how to speak French and made them talk about the social problems of France and then said that I did not investigate anything about why I made this film and said that I did not even feel like investigating because I already knew everything about France because they represent a stereotypical and senseless Mexico. All they needed was the orange filter, the charro hats and the desert everywhere and I still dont understand why this is nominated for best movie.",1,131,12,0.07333333333333333,0.26666666666666666
,"Doctors can only do so much. They can fix bodies, but not souls.","A devious yet frequently overlooked Mexico City defense attorney, Rita, attracts the attention of Manitas, a notorious drug lord and criminal mastermind. Manitas has an interesting request and one that Rita entertains at her peril. For staging his murder, secretly obtaining the perfect surgeon, and providing for his family, Manitas will make Rita rich. The trick is that he will be reborn as she; Emilia. Things go well for a time, but the past begins to creep back. Emilia misses her kids and wife, and doesnt like the new influences on their lives. Emilia struggles to live half in one life, and half in another.This combined narco-thriller, musical, romance, comedy, character-driven social piece, and gender affirmation drama is mind-blowing. The film bumps around to different and interesting locations around the world too. While the film has many plot twists, director Jacques Audiard maintains firm control of the narrative. I really admire and appreciate his work. It is amazing that a film can be so thrilling and funny, and yet manage to get in a plug about the 100,000 plus people who have disappeared in Mexico due to drug violence, but Audiard does it.True to the films multi-faceted and surprising nature, the actors won a combined award at the Cannes film festival for their roles .The film is intriguing and fascinating because it never loses sight of the human nature component. Emilias feelings are natural for what someone in her shoes might ask and wonder about. For example, was she really in love and did people love her? Further, I am enthralled with the French style, particularly its rawness. No one pulls any punches, and no censors are active with their censoring. Pride, truth, forgiveness, love, and more, are all on full display.",9,82,477,0.18963317384370013,0.4608652312599681
,"Unlike the others, I'm not an expert","It seems that everyone writing reviews is an expert now and watched the film at some festival, well im not, Im just a movie watcher and I will tell u what I liked both as a movie watcher and as a Mexican-American. I watched this movie thinking it was gonna be dumb, I dont like musicals but I like Selena Gomez. Well this movie turned out to be anything but. The script was amazing and even the musical numbers were amazing, especially the song by the little kid. I read a review that said that watching Zoe Saldana sing was like watching a novice or some bs like that, but as a regular person whos not an expert, she was good. Selena didnt sing as much as Zoe so we got to enjoy much more of Ms Zaldanas voice. The story truly was compelling in its intricacies and never let u forget what the main story was about.Towards the beginning the doctor says that if a mans supposed to be a man hell be a man but if hes supposed to be a woman shell be a woman and I was reminded of that when the beast shows itself. Very good story that also puts the irony of Emilias work in the forefront. Ill have to watch it again to catch everything since its definitely worth a second watch.The only minuses are that Mexicans are not interchangeable with other Latin American countries and frankly Zoe sounds Colombian And some words are literally translated which show that an American wrote the movie and not a native speaker. Morgue in Mexican is amfiteatro not morgue. For small things like that I rated it a 7 and not a much higher number.",7,9,84,0.14856666666666665,0.4626102564102563
,"Dont let awards fool you, this movie is BAD","This would have been better served as a straightforward drama. That said, as its presented, this movie manages to be both vapid pretentious - with songs/dance numbers that are boring, unmemorable, and, at times, feel completely incongruous. Also, outside of Zoe Saldana, its a lot of bad to mediocre performances.I dont understand what the point of this was. Am I supposed to empathize with the former cartel kingpin? Why was Zoe Saldanas character chosen to be involved with everything to begin with? The entire plot/storyline is disorienting disjointed.

,Emilia Pérez,"Rita is a lawyer in Mexico who finds her professionalism attracting the attention of the powerful drug lord Manitas. He spends his time heavily guarded and constantly on the move as he pretty much controls the synthetic drug trade in and out of his country. What does he want with Rita though? Well tempted by a great deal of money, she makes the perilous trip to meet him and find out. Suffice to say she gets quite a shock when she discovers that he is determined to become a woman. Rita is now charged with the ultra-discrete task of finding a surgeon who can turn Manitas into Emilia. Not only is this highly dangerous for the lawyer, but its also no walk in the park for the gangster or his family who will need to be relocated and convinced that dad is no more. What now ensues tests the mettle of both characters, especially as the erstwhile father struggles rather more than hed anticipated when it comes to losing his wife Jessi and his two young children. Can he stay out of their lives for ever or might he succumb to that temptation and set the cat amongst the familial pigeons? The story is a bit too episodic and the characterisations superficial at times, which is a shame. That said, though, there is still a strong and emotionally powerful effort from Karla Sofía Gascón as the ruthlessly violent killer who undergoes more than a physical transformation over the four or five year period this drama covers. Saldana also holds this together well delivering an engaging performance as a character who has perhaps lost faith in what the system can do to make things better for ordinary people, so adopts a more inside the tent of the enemy approach. Its peppered with musical numbers. Some of those work better than others at introducing delicacy, love, lust and anger into the proceedings but lets be under no illusions that there are any great singers here. I found the denouement a bit rushed and frankly rather weak, but the whole film does shine rather a provocative light on attitudes to gender identification and just as importantly to corruption and the relatively minimal value placed on human life in country where someone almost always works for someone else. Its just a little over two hours, but once it gets into gear it doesnt hang around making for a decent watch tackling important topics thats worth a gander.",7,13,137,0.15101351351351355,0.5838159588159588

The songs try to be emotional, but they end up being unrhythmic and non-storytelling disasters. How this movie could win so many Golden Globes is beyond my comprehension. Very distressed to see this movie receive any type of recognition. The ending tries to be tragic, but ends up leaving more questions than answers. What a mess.

,Emilia The ganster and the love,"I didnt found the movie that bad to be honest but there are some things that bothered me during my time watching it .Im not really fan about how they balanced things between musical and serious moments: there are some times that i felt that even the actors didnt know how they performed when there was some serious moment or musical . Even the musical part i was not that fan : for me it was a lot of noise and it get pretty distracting when they revealing some part of the stories while singing . I was not a big fan of this.But for me the thing that i really enjoyed and i think the most interesting thing in that movie was that trio : Emilia , Jessi and Rita .It was very interesting because Emilia was a man before , she was the ex husband of Jessi and Rita know that .And after that it was an interesting game between all these elements : When Jessi announce she is getting married and will bring the kids with her in front of Emilia and us as a viewer we know who is Emilia and we know it will not go very well . And at the same time we know the movie will offer that confrontation between Jessi and Emilia and the truth will be revealed .I like that kind of suspense and when she knows , she knows .I love also that scene when Jessi , Rita and Emilia was on the phones and we saw how Rita tried to handle every person during the big problem between Emilia , Jessi .It have some interesting moments also all along but the beginning took some times to really give the real interest , in my opinion, in that movie .I was a little bit scared at first : i was very confusing and didnt understand what that movie was really about : the trailer didnt give too much info too . But after a few moments we know whats going to happen and it generate suspense and interest to the movie again but once again the musical part was not that necessary in my opinion and sometimes was too much distracting sadly.But i appreciate it anyway and found it a little bit long for what the movie is really about .So im still mixed feeling about this movie and its clearly not for everyone but i appreciate the trio Emilia, Rita, Jessi and i love the musical when it was Jessi who performed on the bed : it was very sensual .But what i love also its that we saw a lot of womens on screen and its a really good thing in my opinion and i enjoyed watching it . Despite not liking the musical part , i need to say that the visuals make it pleaseant anyway .We had also that side story about workers and bad conditions of work but it was not really that impactful in my opinion. There was also some moments where i felt also that the movie lack clearly of directions but its watchable and i think after a while when you will see what the movie is really about it will be suspensful and interesting despite a long and slow build .Good Anyway.",6,5,46,0.11544025157232707,0.39738993710691817

,Original and not because it is a musical,"Lets talk about musicals. It seems that in this point of time in my life, I am flooded with them until almost drowning. Ive initiated one with the Kids , prepared myself for another, for a long time and now this. Oh, and lets not forget about Wicked - Part I.I wasnt prepared for this musical, though a lot of signs suggested that this is the direction of this movie. Ive embraced it.

It is all over the place with songs that arent related with the situation they are sung at. It is stuffed with a lot of themes and a lot of subjects keeps pushing themselves into the plot without developing with a proper arc and without a proper care, but the charm of this movie is its originality. And there are tons of it.It was pretty tiring and frustrating to see each and every situation develops and becoming a song. Not always related, as mentioned above and not even in sync with the movies rhythm, but there is something captivating it this story that is assembled out of multi-genre ideas and performances.The movie keeps forgetting where he left on the last act and continues into another, where it seems logic for it needs to pick up and go to the next stop. It is a Cartel violent movie for several moments, melodrama that couldnt get enough and off course it is talking about sex change and frustrated woman, that cant seem to be satisfied from her life course.Its about choices, about creating an inner phoenix to rise from the ashes of your old self and if you can sing about it...why the hell not? It is over hyped and doesnt worth any participation for any major Oscar nomination, but Zoe Saldana might be the exceptional due to her superb performance in this film.Saldana leads it safely to its destination, though it tends to go off course sometimes, it is still great entertainment and does a wonderful job with supplying the proper amount of escapism, that Is soaked with an except quantity of realism to create some balance for it.",7,10,124,0.13476325757575755,0.4698358585858585

Ive never been to Mexico City and it still took me 5 seconds to realize that and again, the fact that it wasnt obvious to Hollywood is something that should worry them.The musical numbers feel strange and out of place, the conversations are not very fluid, they seem written by AI and the terrible Spanish makes it impossible to watch the film as a Latin American.I pirated the movie to watch it and I still want my money back.",1,118,13,-0.1359126984126984,0.46775030525030525
,I could have done without the songs,"My Review - Emilia Pèrez In cinemas now My Rating. 7.5 /10Emilia Pèrez is certainly one of the most unusual movies of this year or many other years that Ive experienced so Ill begin my non spoiler review with the more unusual aspects of this movie .I can honestly say I enjoyed most of this movie set in Mexico but entirely shot in Paris that features only one Mexican born actor Adriana Paz who plays Epifania a major supporting role.Its also unusual for the fact that all the award nominations categories so far place the actress with more screen time Zoe Salanda in the Best Supporting category .Karla Sofía Gascón the transgender actress who plays the title character Emilia Pèrez and Manitas his male self is certainly impressive but has less screen time in the movie 52:21 min than Zoe Saldana 57:50 who is cast as Rita the lawyer who is recruited by Manitas a Mexican drug cartel criminal to arrange his greatest wish a gender reassignment.Both actors certainly give wonderful performances but as an aside I dont think Ill be the only person to get Jennifer Coolidge vibes from Karla Sofía Gascón at times her resemblance and mannerisms are uncanny thats not meant as a criticism its just an observation.The plot centres around four very different and complex women in Mexico each pursuing their own lifes journey and aspirations.They are Mexican drug Cartel leader Manitas a ruthless criminal later to become Emilia Pérez , Rita an over qualified and unappreciated lawyer who is recruited by Manitas to arrange his gender reassignment change from male to female . Rita later becomes Emilias protector and greatest ally following her bosses gender change and is tasked with relocating and supplying Manitas wife Jessi and children with new identities.The other two women both have emotional and financial attachment to Manitas and Emilia Pérez ,his wife Jessi played by Selena Gomez and later Emilias love interest Epifania played by Adriana Paz.Sound complicated ? No not really each woman has to negotiate a tricky and complex journey due to the consequences of Manitas life changing operation to fulfill his greatest wish to become Emilia Pèrez .My main criticism of the movie Emilia Pèrez is that it is promoted as a musical drama ? In my opinion the use of contemporary wrap style songs really dont add anything to what is a drama not a musical .The songs are used like a Greek chorus to move the narrative along but for me were only an unwelcome distraction and not very good.The fact that Director Jacques Audiard is being nominated for all major movie awards so far and that Jon M. Chu the Director of Wicked a really fabulous musical movie is being rudely snubbed by The Golden Globes and BAFTA awards really annoys me.I certainly dont think Jacques Audiard has written and directed the best movie of the year but I think Emilia Pérez is one of the best movies on offer in the 2024 movie year.As mentioned I could have done without the music plus a little more attention to detail an example being that any male in transition and taking female hormones for 2 years as stated in the script would not have a bushy black beard .I realise the beard was probably used to give Manitas and Karla Sofía Gascón who plays both roles a dramatic more rugged macho appearance but it wasnt convincing for me who has a little knowledge on such things .Is Emilia Pérez a positive story for the transgender community?I dont think it tries to be and shouldnt be viewed that way for me the movie is a morality tale about thinking well about the consequences of drastic life changes on others beside yourself plus that we can change ourselves in many ways but if our past is not resolved it can catch up with us no matter who we are ?",7,5,48,0.15055356520873758,0.503191023535851
,When you saw a couple of bad movies came this one,"In 2024, we witnessed two of the worst movies of the year: Madame Web and Joker 2. Just when we thought nothing could be worse, Emilia Perez came along.This film was intended to showcase Mexican actresses and be filmed in Mexico, yet none of that is evident throughout the movie. The director did not take the time to research the country he aimed to portray.As a musical, it falls flat; the music is quite mediocre-almost as if it were generated by ChatGPT-and the performances are largely disappointing, except Zoe Saldañas.This movie serves as a glaring example of how a film can insult the entire Latin American continent through its portrayal of our culture.It is incomprehensible how this film received 13 Oscar nominations.",1,68,6,-0.19722222222222222,0.36666666666666664
,Non-stop thrill ride,"Hold her. Protect her.Me encanta la película.To say that I was sceptical of this movie would be an understatement. On paper, it shouldnt work, but never have I been gladder to be wrong. Fortunately, the film exceeded my expectations. Watching this movie is equivalent to getting a dose of heroin injected into your veins. The film blends in various genres at once and not only succeeds at it but outright knocks it out of the park and surpasses my lukewarm expectations. It starts off as a procedural drama and musical, then seamlessly transitions into a family drama, crime comedy, and thriller. The director doubles down and explores all these genres to their full extent. The film also suggests that it is kind of a gangster epos, telling the story of a cartel boss on a journey of self-discovery. Ever since he was a child, he dreamt of being someone else. It is strange to me that these kinds of people have those aspirations. I always think they lack empathy and are not very progressive. This might be quite narrow-minded of me to say and might land me in hot water with some people, but its what I believe and what I experienced. If that makes me out of touch, then so be it. Im not really involved with those kinds of people, but Im glad I was exposed to this otherworldly world. On a happier note, Selena Gomez is phenomenal and radiates beauty in this film.Selena Gomez has always been a terrific actress, but this movie takes it to a whole other level. Im a simple guy. If I see Selena Gomez singing and dancing in Spanish, it is an automatic five stars. She has never looked more beautiful. Its true what they say: you become more beautiful as you age. Ill always be a fan of Selena Gomez, no matter what. If her character in the movie wants to brutally torture her very close friend , then thats her pejorative.I cant wait to download the films soundtrack so I can listen to it on repeat. Im the kind of person who listens and obsesses over a song for months on end. The film can get quite dark at times, but the doom and gloom aspects are balanced out by the incredible and wholesome musical moments. The musical moments were without a doubt magnificent and flawlessly executed. The viewer is completely immersed in the diegetic world thanks to the thrilling and catchy songs.The ending is, to put it simply, heartbreaking. I never expected a happy ending, but I thought Emilias life would continue. Emilia/Manitas wanted to spare Jessi from the pain of their transgender operation. But I think they underestimated her, as is evident throughout the film, especially the unfortunate and tragic ending. The film really captures the transgender experience realistically. One might decree that the film is a clever commentary on transgender identity and how it impacts all the facets of their life.In a nutshell, the film is an adrenaline-fuelled spectacle with action, humour, suspense, thrills, and, not to forget, song and dance. It was difficult to ascertain the mood of the audience , but I think that most people enjoyed it like me. Its certainly a divisive film. Emilia Perez is the wackiest, surrealist, intoxicating original musical of the decade so far. It had everything you could possibly want from a film, making for a super fun and memorable cinema-going experience.Final verdict: 10/10The film kind of reminded me of this quote from Donald Trump: Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.

,I gave it a 7 because of Zoe,"I value Emilia Perez as a valid effort to become part of a memorable film. Nonetheless, this movie lacks consistency and it appears that it needed better management and quality control. Proof of that are the pitfalls during the climax scene: poor script, clumsy edition, painful overacting, and erratic camera movement.The rhythm and storys atmosphere were still visible but didnt add enough as to be considered Oscar material. Except for Zoe Saldaña, who was able to carry the whole thing on her shoulders. Shame on Selena Gomez, but kudos to Karla Sofia Gascón. All in all, one tends to feel sorry about its direction and production in general, especially if we consider that with a better assemblance, this could have deserved much more praise.Acting: 7.

,Just awful,"This is one of the -if not the- worst movie Ive ever seen, and Im not exaggerating. I even created an account just to write this. At one point during the film, I found myself wondering if it was so groundbreaking that I simply couldnt understand it.Its not just the much-discussed poor representation of Mexico, or the terrible Spanish spoken by most of the cast, or even the horrendous songs. The real problem is that the plot makes absolutely no sense. The movie touches on several themes but fails to explore any of them in depth. It feels as if they cut all the scenes that might have given the story some coherence or emotional weight, making it impossible to connect with or care about the characters.I honestly would love to know if the actors and production team genuinely liked the final result, because its still hard for me to believe that anyone could see this as a good movie.

,What a brilliant movie,"2nd time now I try to review the movie. I have finally seen the movie. What happened just now? I have to admit that Im not that fond of movie musicals, but this is just genius. The plot, the music, the acting are just amazingly good. It doesnt feel like a musical at all. The story is so intense and good that you forget they are singing the lines. It has all the drama, excitement, music and everything mixed in a wonderful mix. Hot like chilli, sweet and sour like tequila, a real explosion of Mexico. A firework indeed. The best movie Ive seen in a long time and 2024 was really a really good movie year. Holy crap go see the movie and enjoy it. I dont understand those who are so condescending to the film. Never mind this, go see the movie and make up your own mind about it.

,mesmerizing first half,"Theres a new movie out now thats getting lots of award buzz, EMILIA PÉREZ. Loosely based on the 2018 novel Écoute by Boris Razon, this is a genre-defying experience. If I had to nail it down, its a Spanish-language musical melodrama that gets wrapped up in social commentary. It focuses on three women, all searching for purpose in life and their version of happiness. The first is Rita , an underappreciated lawyer who gets an opportunity to change her life. She meets ruthless cartel leader Manitas , who asks her for covert legal help with going through gender affirmation surgery. Four years later, Rita happens upon Emilia Pérez , now a founder of a non-profit organization that helps people find their missing loved ones from the ramifications of cartel violence. Jessi is the wife of Emilia, which adds a layer of complexity to the story, including her two kids. This has a personal and emotional story. Its very ambitious, perhaps too ambitious. I was absolutely mesmerized by the first half, but the story doesnt know what to focus on in the latter half. It tries a few ideas that are good, but dont have time to go deeper than surface-level, so it sort of muddies the narrative. The performances are what shone the most here. They each have emotional weight to them. EMILIA PÉREZ is nominated for 10 Golden Globes, and it could very well snag a few, but Im not as enthusiastic about it as some people clearly are. Still, its on Netflix, so I recommend it!",7,6,67,0.09074640637140637,0.3918020347707848

And it seems like they just used Emilias gender transition as excuses for the horrible things she did before her gender transition. And they used Ai in the movie.

Dont let the musical designation scare you - the music is well worked into the films structure.

Emilias struggle with wanting to keep her past family close and make up for her past life leads to complicated moral struggles that show the past is never past. All three main actors give boffo performances. Yet, there is a thinness to the film. It doesnt really work as a trans journey, making the process seem easy.

,"I am Mexican, and believe me when I say that this movie is a fraud.","The film Emilia Pérez is an unfortunate example of how marketing and commercial appeal are overshadowing artistic and narrative quality in todays film industry. While it attempts to tackle sensitive topics such as gender identity and violence in Mexico, its approach lacks depth, rigor, and proper research. Its portrayal of Mexican culture is stereotypical and exoticized, disconnected from reality, trivializing complex and significant issues.Selena Gomezs performance is a notable weak point: her limited Spanish and unconvincing delivery undermine the credibility of her character. This, combined with an inconsistent and poorly written script, highlights a lack of care in overall direction. Despite Jacques Audiards talent as a director, creative decisions seem more focused on generating media buzz than crafting an authentic and meaningful work.The recognition of Emilia Pérez with awards and nominations reflects a troubling decline in film criticism. Instead of valuing profound and well-executed artistic proposals, the industry rewards projects that prioritize controversy and marketing. This highlights the growing disconnect between true art and commercial strategies.In summary, not only fails as a cinematic work but also symbolizes an industry that has lost its way, sacrificing authenticity and the value of cinema as an art form in favor of superficial consumption.",1,113,13,0.0529100529100529,0.5386243386243387
,Audiard excels again,"Greetings again from the darkness. For those who have been anxiously awaiting the first Spanish language-crime thriller-gender affirming-musical filled with violence, humor, romance, and on-the-nose songs, the talented French filmmaker Jacques Audiard has delivered. Its also one of the years best films and deserved its place as Frances Oscar submission for Best International Film. Audiard based the film on the 2018 novel Ecoute by Boris Razon, and its a wild trip for viewers.Zoe Saldana plays Rita, a criminal defense attorney whose boss takes credit for her brilliant law work in keeping their likely guilty clients out of jail. After her most recent legal maneuvering, she receives a mysterious caller offering her the opportunity to make big bucks. With a bag on her head, Rita is escorted to her clandestine meeting with infamous cartel kingpin, Manitas. Known for his ruthless approach to business, Manitas is intimidating with hushed voice and a mouth filled with gold teeth.Normally, I would not discuss the details of their meeting, but since its spelled out in the official synopsis and the trailers, I wont shy away from disclosing that Ritas high-paying mission is to coordinate a new life and identity for Manitas ... a life as the woman hes always believed himself to be. Manitas is played by Karla Sofia Gascon, the first trans actor to win an acting award at Cannes. We only get a small dose of Manitas, and instead, after the surgery performed in secret by Dr. Wasserman , we see much of her new life as Emilia Perez.This new life means staging his death and living apart from his wife Jessi and kids. Emilia and Rita create an organization that allows Emilia to make amends for that previous life. A clever strategy also reunites her with Jessi and the kids, though not with full disclosure. The aptly named Epifania enters Emilias life through this new work, offering hope of second love for both. Of course, some of lifes actions put atonement out of reach, and the blissful new world is not without challenges. Jessi coming clean on her feelings for Gustavo awakens an old feeling in Emilia, and the storys tone erupts.Its pretty easy to imagine this resulting in a mess of a movie ... especially since Ive avoided detailing the singing and musical moments. In fact, its quite a gem. Some similarities to Pedro Almodovars work are obvious . The multiple shifts in tone may distract some viewers, but the cast does incredible work. Zoe Saldana handles the dramatic work quite well and her big choreographed number at a gala is a true showstopper. Karla Sofia Gascon is remarkable in the dual role, and Adriana Paz and Edgar Ramirez contribute, despite limited screen time. Director Audiard has built a strong resume with THE SISTERS BROTHERS , DHEEPAN , RUST AND BONE , and A PROPHET . He has topped them all with this female-centric story filled with violence, melodrama, and music. Its a bit bonkers, though thoroughly entertaining for those who accept it for the spectacle that it is.In select theaters on November 1, 2024 and on Netflix beginning November 14, 2024.",9,23,154,0.13828507558015754,0.5192445532609465
,"It's a musical, a comedy, a drama, a thriller... It's Emilia Perez.","Emilia PerezEmilia Perez is a bonkers and audacious story of identity and transformation. With its vibrant vision and daring story, the film showcases a director brimming with confidence in their craft. But does it ultimately deliver on its ambitious promise?In this film, a Mexican cartel leader, Manitas, seeks the help of a lawyer, Rita, to facilitate not only a gender transition but also a complete disappearance. Tasked with managing the estate left behind for his family, Rita ensures the plan goes off without a hitch. Years later, now living as Emilia Perez, the former kingpin hatches a bold scheme to reconnect with her family.Emilia Perez is an ambitious, chaotic ride that doesnt always hit the mark. The films relentless drive to distinguish itself as unique often overshadows the core story, leaving it feeling somewhat diluted. However, its saving grace lies in its musical elements, which inject a vibrant energy into an otherwise tame story. While the musical numbers are far from flawless-occasionally rough, awkward, or even embarrassingly laughable-they embody the quirky, audacious spirit that defines Emilia Perez. These moments, imperfect as they are, are what make the film memorable.Emilia, as a character, lacks the bite one might expect given her tumultuous past. While its clear that her transformation signifies a fresh start, the notion of a complete reinvention feels implausible. Someone with her history would carry remnants of their former life, and this disconnect makes her portrayal feel incomplete. Furthermore, Emilias journey seems oddly unchallenged. No one questions her identity, nor do her altruistic actions raise any suspicion-an oversight that feels unrealistic in the high-stakes world she inhabits. These gaps undermine the complexity of her character and the believability of her story.The films style is beautifully complemented by its cinematography. The clever use of camera angles perfectly aligns with the movies rambunctious nature. This visual approach not only enhances the storytelling but also matches the films chaotic charm.The performances in Emilia Perez are solid. Zoe Saldana is a standout, delivering a revelatory performance as she seamlessly sings, raps, dances, and acts her way through the role with brilliance. Zoe doesnt play the titular character but its as much her story as it is Emilias- in fact, she has the most screentime. Karla Sofia Gascón serves as the emotional core of the film, embodying both facets of her character. Meanwhile, Selena Gomez, though competent, is unfortunately overshadowed by her co-stars. Her characters limitations prevent her from fully stepping into the spotlight, leaving her underutilized in the grander scheme of the narrative.Its a musical, a comedy, a drama, a thriller...

,"Bold Choices, Chaotic Beauty","Emilia Pérez is a challenge. An extravagant musical about a drug lord who decides to change his life after embracing his identity as a trans woman? Its such a bold idea that its bound to divide opinions, but director Jacques Audiard doesnt hold back on style or emotion. Despite its questionable choices, the film delivers a visual and narrative experience that, while not entirely convincing, is impossible to ignore.Lets start by saying the film doesnt aim to be an authentic portrayal of Mexico. Shot in Parisian studios and led by a French director, Emilia Pérez creates a Mexico thats more like a fever dream than a grounded reality. Audiard uses the setting as a backdrop, focusing more on the protagonists internal journey than on capturing the essence of Mexican culture. Still, he incorporates familiar elements, like tabloid headlines and protests against femicides, adding texture to the artificial landscape.At the heart of the story is Karla Sofía Gascón, delivering an impressive dual performance as Manitas Del Monte, the ruthless drug lord, and Emilia Pérez, a woman seeking redemption. Gascón transitions between these extremes powerfully, humanizing both the criminal and her new identity. Her performance in the musical numbers is especially striking, conveying rare vulnerability, particularly when she sings about her transition and her longing to escape the brutality of her past. Alongside Gascón, Zoe Saldaña shines as Rita, the lawyer hired to facilitate Manitas transition. Saldaña masterfully balances the absurdity of the situations with a performance full of guilt and ambition. Selena Gomez also impresses as the protagonists scorned wife, delivering a raw, daring performance, though her character doesnt get as much depth as it deserves.The musical sequences, however, are what truly define Emilia Pérez. They range from sublime to outright bizarre, with over-the-top choreography and lyrics that dont always land. At times, they feel forced, but theres an infectious energy to them-a chaotic invitation to embrace the madness. Audiard and cinematographer Paul Guilhaume lean into saturated, hyper-stylized visuals, crafting an aesthetic thats equal parts mesmerizing and exhausting. The balance between chaos and precision keeps viewers engaged, even when the narrative falters.Emilias redemption arc is the heart of the film, but it comes with contradictions. In seeking to atone for her past crimes, she often resorts to the same violence shes trying to leave behind. This duality raises compelling questions about power, identity, and guilt, though the script doesnt always delve into them as deeply as it could. Nevertheless, its hard not to be moved by the protagonists emotional journey, largely thanks to Gascóns performance.On the downside, the film struggles with cultural authenticity. While the script includes colloquial expressions and familiar Latin elements, the actors accents and Audiards outsider perspective give away the lack of true connection to the culture. This can be frustrating for audiences seeking a more genuine representation of Mexico and its complexities. Ultimately, the film is more of a stylized fantasy than a realistic reflection of the social issues it touches on.That said, Emilia Pérez doesnt try to be a traditional social drama. Its a narcotic opera, a blend of melodrama and extravagance designed to provoke intense reactions-whether admiration or discomfort. Its a film that would rather take risks than stick to conventions, and that alone makes it worth noticing. Despite its flaws, its boldness and the sincerity at the core of its narrative are hard to ignore.In the end, Emilia Pérez isnt for everyone. Its a film that challenges expectations and pushes the boundaries of whats acceptable, but for those willing to go along for the ride, it offers a one-of-a-kind experience. Its colorful, chaotic, and above all, human-even in its excess. A curious mix that, like an unusual recipe, may not suit all tastes but leaves a lasting impression.",7,6,71,0.06674893733717265,0.49692770464829294

The musicals are so good and ZOE brings a joy that is often lost with now a-day musicals. Karla stands out so brightly and her storyline may be controversial but isnt being trans controversial enough.

,Emilia Perez: Everything Everywhere all at once!!!!,"The movie Emilia Perez has a one-of-a-kind plot that tells the story of a cartel leader who transitions into a woman, exploring themes of identity, transformation, and redemption in Mexico. Director and writer Jacques Audiard once again plays with an intriguing what if scenario, mixing the familiar with the unexpected. What if a tough, violent drug dealer became a woman fighting for human rights? What if a traditional family was reimagined as two mothers? What if a lawyer with a bright future ended up working for a drug kingpin? And, on top of that, what if you blended all these elements into a musical, crime, comedy, and drama movie? This is exactly what the Emilia Perez movie is, and it works very well.Emilia Perez feels like that movie where everything happens everywhere all at once.The musical numbers are enjoyable and perfectly complement the script, with well-written lyrics. Zoe Saldana, playing lawyer Rita Moro Castro, delivers the songs with a nice voice.One of the movies flaws is the final 30 minutes, where it feels like director Audiard lost interest in the plots flow and opted for an abrupt ending. It genuinely seems like he hit a moment of writers block.",7,6,73,0.18055555555555555,0.5829166666666666
,Groundbreakingly Awful,"It took me a long time to truly digest this movie and reach a reasonable conclusion about my opinions on it. My reflections about it concentrated on the proposal of the movie and its execution instead of naturally inducing my mind to deep reflections , which is usually not good.In summation, I think the movie is simply weak. It is a musical with bad music , and this fact alone usually taints the whole movie. The end is just the worst Ive seen in a long time, but maybe Ive set my bar too high. I mean, if you call it a drama, please give it a decent drama ending. I cringed.Im not Mexican, but Im Latina, and to read about how the production disrespected Mexico really upset me. If you scroll you can read a Brit telling us to get over it because she is watching these Hollywood producers misportray England since forever, and that was really unsettling. England is a first-world colonizer country, and was the great world potency until WW2. Stereotyping countries such as Mexico in movies is simply not the same.I could go on and on, but I recommend the curious reader to watch it because it will make you wonder if the movie is actually good . Critics are saying the movie is groundbreaking, and I agree that it is groundbreakingly awful.",1,57,5,-0.07024305555555556,0.5163740079365079
,Artistic and refreshing,"Emilia Pérez is an untypical musical that captivates with its layered storytelling and nuanced surprises. While musicals often follow a predictable formula, this film defies conventions, drawing viewers into a story that is both rhythmic and unexpected. The three lead actors deliver outstanding performances, adding authenticity to characters that feel real and relatable. The narrative flows almost like music, tension, and emotion in a way that keeps you guessing. Just when you expect the story to settle, it surprises again, proving to be a truly refreshing experience. Emilia Pérez stands out as a bold, memorable journey that redefines what a musical can be.",10,27,199,0.21481481481481482,0.5935185185185186

Im not sure Selena was the right person for this role and understand why shes not nominated like the 2 others.

I understand why this story has been talked about throughout the year and I also like the fact if youre telling this story to someone they might find it funny and crazy but if they actually go watch it they might get emotional.

This is and insult to Mexicans who are currently suffering from the cartels, now imagine if they knew a movie that talks about it is nominated as a comedy or musical in award shows.

,"A lot of singing, but yea... okay","Emilia Pérez presents a story boldly with a unique concept. Family, ambition, the possibility of change, self-identity, regret, redemption, and grief are the themes explored in this film. The plot of this film raises a topic that is quite controversial, but it doesnt really interfere with the good storytelling. This film combines contradictory genres, namely musical, crime and drama, but managed to make it quite good and interesting. Even though musically its a bit too much, it doesnt really interfere with the story, because the lyrics are made like dialogue too. Jacques Audiard always knows how to develop his characters, even though this film isnt that extraordinary, its still really good. If we remove the musical elements, this film might still not feel slowburn, because somehow it can keep us awake. The visuals presented here are really pleasing to the eye with extraordinary shots, be it ordinary scenes or musical scenes. The original soundtrack for this film sounds really good, although the English lyrics are a bit less enjoyable. All of their acting here is very good, Selena Gomezs acting is quite convincing.

,Offensive and exploitative,"Emilia Perez attempts to tackle important themes like missing persons, violence, corruption, and the experiences of trans individuals, set against the backdrop of Mexico City. However, the film falls short by centering these narratives through the perspective of a white Frenchman who seems disconnected from the complexities and realities of these issues. The lack of research and cultural insight is evident, leading to a portrayal that feels superficial and, at times, even exploitative. Instead of shedding light on these serious topics with sensitivity and authenticity, the film glosses over them, ultimately reducing them to mere plot devices. This approach not only misrepresents these profound issues but also perpetuates stereotypes and undermines the lived experiences of those affected by them.Emilia Perez had the potential to provide a powerful commentary, but its clear that without a deep understanding of the cultural and social landscape of Mexico, it fails to do justice to the stories it seeks to tell.",1,422,72,-0.003333333333333327,0.5058333333333334
,They don't make movies like this often,"Love it or hate it, Emilia Perez is the biggest swing of the year, combining so many genres and themes in a swirl of cinematic gusto that its a wonder the film never collapses under its own weight. Its an entrancing movie from first frame to last, one that dazzles you at every turn even if the pieces arent quite all there.Perhaps the most intriguing part of the premise is how it handles its musical numbers, but thankfully the film delivers in spades. The film is packed full of songs but not one of them feels unnecessary, and theyre genuinely fun romps. They range from heartfelt, to dramatic, to incredibly catchy, to all 3. The highlight is El Mal, in which Zoe Saldana raps about the corruption of the Mexican government with style to spare and a tune that absolutely will not leave your mind. Theres even a song about gender confirmation surgery, how can you not love it? I look at a musical like Joker 2, where each number is just an incredibly lifeless display of characters walking around whisper-singing tunes that add almost nothing to the movie, and the difference couldnt be more stark. Even as some of the numbers can feel a bit amateurish, theyre so alive and energetic.Emilia Perez harkens back to an older approach to storytelling, where the primary drive is the characters emotions rather than the machinations of a plot. There is an engaging narrative, to be sure, one that travels from Bangkok to Switzerland, to the villas of Mexico City to its harsh and remote desert. But at its core its a modern-day opera. I was sceptical about the musical aspect going in but it truly does feel as though song is the only language for which the emotions of the characters can be expressed.With all the bonkers plot twists and musical numbers, its imperative to have a cast thats game, and thankfully they more than impress. Saldana as embittered lawyer Rita looking to do good goes from cynical to hopeful to fearing for her life, never missing a beat and bringing down the house in her songs. Selena Gomez as the cartel leaders wife Jessi is a character I wish appeared more often, but she leaves an impression with her screentime-one conversation between her and Emilia might just be the best acting youll see all year. But its Karla Sofía Gascon as Emilia Perez who emerges as the best performance, tying the entire film together and crucially connecting us to her emotional journey, and by extension the emotions of the whole film.Emilia Perez covers a remarkable amount of territory in little time, and touches on such a wide range of issues that it can be accused of shallowness. But I see it more as context for the characters personalities and feelings. It addresses topics like government corruption, discrimination, and drug cartels not because it has the answers but because they fuel the fires burning within the characters. We all live in a society where were forced to coexist with problems beyond our control, so too does Emilia, Rita, and Jessi. Emilia Perez is a movie about ourselves: how we choose to live our lives, how we choose to deal with our past demons, how we choose to be remembered. Through all the gunfights and song numbers and chaos its ultimately the story of one womans journey to become a better person, and it ends up being something undeniably touching and beautiful.Final score: 81/100.",8,10,57,0.14939352541811557,0.49813296903460835
,"Overstuffed, but Outstanding Cinematography and Lighting","Emilia Pérez is overstuffed, but its cinematography and lighting are gorgeous.This is a review of the movie and not a judgement of the people who made it!Trans and Mexican Representation I heard that trans and Mexican people have criticized this movie for misrepresentation and I see it. For example, when Emilia transitions she becomes a totally different person and I think that is wrong. I would think when a person transitions, they become and feel more like themselves, but they dont become completely different people.Experience I went into it thinking I would hate like everyone else I follow on Letterboxd. That wasnt the case. I had my issues with it, but overall the experience was quite enjoyable.Writing The characters are interesting, but their arcs are rushed and definitely not earned. I usually dont like when the protagonist is a morally bad person. Rita is a lawyer and she does bad things because she has to, but ultimately she is not a good person and the movie uses her like she was. Emilia is a criminal and the movie just doesnt really acknowledge that. The movie has themes of sexuality, love and crime, but its just not well-put together. What is this movie even about? I have a few different ideas, but they dont work together, so at the end of the day I got no idea.Technical Aspects The cinematography and lighting are gorgeous, one the best of 2024. The editing on the other hand, isnt that good in my opinion. The movie is too freaking long, I was bored at times. Especially during the songs. Most of them are forgettable, but I remember Mi Camino being really great though. There was not much scoring outside of the songs, but I loved what I heard. The acting performances are hit or miss. Zoe Saldaña is really good, Selena Gomez became a powerhouse by the end and Karla Sofía Gascón did an amazing job, but I dont think any of them deserve the Oscar nominations.Academy Awards This is a great movie from some aspects like cinematography, but 13 nominations? In my opinion it definitely doesnt deserve that.Emilia Pérez is messy, there are too many different themes, its confusing in that sense.",7,1,5,0.07202380952380953,0.5180555555555555
,Awful in too many senses,"I had high hopes for Emilia Pérez, but unfortunately, it fell far short of expectations. The premise had potential, blending drama, comedy, and crime in a unique way, but the execution was lackluster.The pacing of the film felt inconsistent, with drawn-out scenes that added little to the story and abrupt transitions that made it hard to stay engaged. The characters lacked depth, leaving their motivations unclear and making it difficult to connect with them. Even the comedic elements felt forced and out of place, failing to land in most instances.Visually, while there were some striking moments, the cinematography and set design often felt uninspired and repetitive. The soundtrack, which could have been a strong point, didnt complement the tone of the film and seemed disconnected from the narrative.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the story itself. What promised to be a compelling and daring plot ended up being predictable and riddled with clichés. It seemed to rely heavily on surface-level gimmicks rather than delivering meaningful substance or emotional impact.",1,17,0,-0.012427536231884051,0.6745652173913043
,"Daring, defiant and not perfect","Jacques Audiard continues to show that he is always looking for new things that give him new abilities and with Emilia Pérez he reaches the musical in a strange, but immersive way, which is one of the most hypnotic films of 2024.Presented at Cannes 2024, where it already generated that murmur that invites us to take it into consideration and once you manage to see it, you get the feeling that we are facing a strange combination, but one that becomes addictive like one of those imaginative drugs that take you to strange sensations. Emilia Pérez is a bit of that drug, where the French director offers us a fictional story about identity change, Mexican cartels, rights and healing.The journey that Audiard takes us on has great allies in its leading trio, headed by Zoe Saldana in her best form, who is the true protagonist of the show with a main character that gains strength as we learn everything she hides behind. A Selena Gomez who has the presence of being a megastar and also a very good actress in a supporting role that makes her look like she hasnt been seen for a long time on the big screen. However, the great revelation is Karla Sofía Gascón, who faces with total naturalness a character that means a lot to the actress and her new stage of life. Emilia Pérez is her and she is truly amazing for a charismatic, daring, intense, human and sinister character at the same time.And all of this fits into the reality that we are in the presence of a drug-related musical that, despite the filth of its form, because we must be clear, is not an old-school musical, it is a dirty musical, with daring and unexpected songs and lyrics, but which add a formidable height to a rather groundbreaking visual and sound experience that fascinates in its final result.So what is Emilia Pérez herself?It is a film that goes beyond a film, it is a creative challenge on the part of its director that at times turns out well, at others it turns out a bit more confusing, but it leaves the feeling that we are faced with a hypnotic proposal, impossible to abstract from and that although it has its imperfections, the daring of a director to offer something that breaks the mold seems quite satisfactory to me.It may have wrong and simplistic decisions, but it also has an intention to make you uncomfortable and make you reflect on different aspects that go beyond a visual proposal, it is also a film with intentions to generate mental debate and that for me is the great success of Emilia Pérez.In short, we have one of the most interesting films of the year, which may be strange, but it is daring, it is not perfect, but it is interesting, it is a bet on pure cinema with a director who goes beyond conforming, it is a director who dares to try new things and that is a courage that must be recognized as a great virtue.It deserves to be seen and to have your own feeling about Emilia Perez.",7,4,50,0.13418935902806872,0.48612658846529805

,"Well, that was... something","Emilia Perez is a bizarre movie to say the least, but that doesnt necessarily make it a bad one, not usually anyway. Out of all the plots to make into a musical, this is definitely one of the strangest, and it doesnt always work. The strongest part is arguably the section leading up to when the main character has the surgery, as thats where the plots most flowing. Afterwards, it becomes more episodic, and it sometimes feels like it doesnt know what to do with itself now that the big event has happened, so it just throws in a bunch of stuff, in at least one instance forgetting a plot point from before. With that said, the stuff it throws in is at least interesting and there are some neat ideas, like Emilia using her former mob ties to help find mob victims. The acting is solid, especially from Karla Sofia Gascon and Zoe Saldana. However, I quickly came to the realization that I dont really like Emilia as a character. Shes way too selfish and does some awful things, which makes her really hard to sympathize with.Can I just say that I hate it when a movie has a ridiculous amount of production logos at the start? This film has like seven of them, and I know they want to give the people who worked on it their dues, but as an audience, we just want to get to the movie. Anyway, even though the decision to turn this story into a musical was bonkers, its at least a really good one. The songs are really catchy, well sung and well directed. Theres a decent mixture of fantasy style numbers and real world style ones. And I appreciate seeing a musical where the songs actually develop the characters and give us insight into their headspaces; thats actually really rare nowadays. Outside of the numbers, the film is also well directed, though there are some questionable choices, like a scene where a whole conversation is done in ADR over a really long outside shot of Emilias house.Overall, I liked Emilia Perez to an extent, but some of the choices made really had me scratching my head. I can see why the rating on this site isnt great, because honestly, I dont know what to make of it sometimes. It didnt deserve the Golden Globe for Best Picture Comedy or Musical, I can say that much . Dont know if Id watch it again, but there were enough good scenes to warrant at least one viewing.",7,4,51,0.06433333333333334,0.4521666666666666
,Don't waste your time.,"I dont even know how this movie got made.Its terrible. Like unwatchable terrible.Its not just that the storyline was flat, or the odd depiction of the Mexican drug world, its the bad acting, the unbelievable characters the lack of authenticity that killed it for me.It seemed like they hired 2 really good actors expected their star power would get people in the seats, rather than the quality of the movie. Doesnt matter how good an actor is, if they bare given a bad script, its still a bad script.The movie was WAYYYY too long. Not only did I lose interest 15 mins into the movie, I was watching the clock looking for an exit for the rest of it.I cant compare it to an Opera, because Operas are beautiful the music always touches your soul. These songs were grating and irritating to the soul.But I CAN compare it to JLos This is me....now: A Love Story. If youve ever seen that piece of crap, youll understand what I mean.

,Pretty creative,"The movie caught me off guard, in the best way possible. From my perspective - a viewer who doesnt speak Spanish and isnt deeply familiar with life in Mexico - it felt fresh, creative, and unexpectedly gripping. The decision to cast two high-profile American celebrities was a smart one, a hook for those who might ordinarily skip a film like this.Zoe Saldana was a revelation. Her Spanish wasnt just fluent; it was lived-in, natural, like shed been waiting for this role all along. Selena Gomez surprised me too - sure, shes faced criticism about her Spanish, but to my untrained ear, it sounded decent. More than that, she delivered. She gave effort, and effort counts.But the real standout? Karla Sofia Gascón. By the time those raw, emotional musical moments toward the end hit, it was her performance that stayed with me. She didnt just act - she became something bigger than the story itself. And thats what makes this movie more than just a clever idea. Its captivating, from start to finish.",7,4,51,0.2056739926739927,0.5217313797313798
,It's very insulting and unacceptable,"As a Mexican, it is very offensive for a foreigner to say that he knows enough about a country that he has clearly never visited and to tell a story about a common topic in such a vain and silly way. He has a biased view of what this issue means for our country and anyone who wanted to take advantage of that is simply unacceptable. The songs are an insult to other movies that are musicals indeed. The fact that Sofia called the Mexican public ignorant just because she felt important in the film makes it lose even more of its value.

,Surreal and original,"Emilia Pérez couldve sustained itself on the sheer audacity of its genre bending madness but what makes this musical crime drama about the trans experience really work is the genuine heart at its core. The trans narrative and the musical numbers go hand in hand with an overall unpredictability that gives the film many of its biggest surprises. The crime drama aspects are played surprisingly straight and the middle successfully turns into Mrs. Doubtfire.Zoë Saldaña is fantastic in a performance where she eschews subtlety in favour of something bolder with each musical number showing a previously unseen set of skills. She guides you through the opening moments and then Karla Sofía Gascón begins to take control without Saldaña feeling sidelined. Gascón is amazing because her performance has so much earnesty as she embraces her new life whilst holding onto the best parts of her old one whilst struggling to accept some of the revelations from her former partner.Like some of his previous efforts, Jacques Audiards direction unfolds at a steady pace, taking its time to follow the lives of his characters wherever they go. The musical numbers are excellent with a real variety. Theres a surreal element to them due to their lyrics alone and each one works whether its characters essentially just singing their dialogue or its the bigger choreographed numbers in which Paul Guilhaumes snappy cinematography stands out.",8,20,144,0.20159632034632033,0.37724567099567113
,Interesting plot,"Drug Lords, transgender and a musical? Yes, at first it sounds weird but is interesting.Im not such a big fan of musicals, but the musical scenes were really good.The first 2/3 of the movie is interesting and you are wondering whats going to happen next. The final third goes down and is poorly developed, Id expected more of the same.The acting in general is ok, with Zoe Saldaña doing a good job even tho she doesnt sound Mexican. Actually no character sounds Mexican and thats a low point.Most characters you can understand despite their wrong accent ... the problem gets with Selena Gomez. I know they tried to mask her horrible spanish but it wasnt enough. I like her, but there are lot of other actresses who speak spanish perfectly ... even in Mexico duh.The Selena Gomez accent is no a minor point, from moments you feel like watching Will Ferrel in Casa de mi Padre, and even that was more descent.",7,4,55,0.07630718954248365,0.3626633986928104
,French white man colonizes for entertainment,"Deeply problematic. It seems that Jacques Audiard, after a vacation in Mexico, decided to include everything that caught his attention about our culture in a cinematic project, but without the rigor or sensitivity required to address it properly. Its highly questionable for a white European man to, first of all, create a film about a country that doesnt belong to him, and second, attempt to depict issues like problems for women of color in Mexico, drug trafficking, kidnappings, and gender identity.While its true that filmmakers can explore other cultures, doing so comes with a great responsibility, one that Audiard seems to overlook. If youre going to tackle these topics, the least you could do is give space to authentic Mexican voices, both on and off-screen. Why is Selena Gomez, with poorly learned Spanish, prominently featured in the promotion of the film if shes not even the main character? Why cast a Dominican actress in a role meant to represent a Mexican woman, even forcing her to claim in the film that she is Mexican, when neither her accent nor her appearance aligns with the cultural identity shes supposed to portray? Do you really think all Latinos are the same?The movie tries to do too much and does too less: complex issues are treated superficially, mystified, and misinterpreted. Its painful to see our culture exploited, reduced to a caricature of our struggles, and ultimately colonized for entertainment, especially when these portrayals are celebrated and awarded by people who fail to understand the profound implications of what theyre consuming.That the film industry chooses to place such works on a pedestal only makes me realize the sad reflection of this society.

,Vibrant and audacious.,"Emilia Perez is a vibrant and audacious exploration of identity, transformation, and the fluidity of gender. This musical drama, infused with the intoxicating rhythms of Mexican narcocorridos, tells the story of a drug lord who undergoes a life-altering sex change operation to disappear from the cartel world and re-emerge as the woman she always felt herself to be.Gascón delivers a captivating performance as Emilia, portraying her journey with a delicate balance of vulnerability and strength. Her portrayal is both fierce and tender, capturing the complexities of a character grappling with the ghosts of her past while embracing a newfound freedom.Audiard masterfully blends genres, seamlessly weaving together elements of musical, thriller, and melodrama, creating a truly unique and unforgettable cinematic experience. The films visual style is equally striking, with bold colors and dynamic camerawork that perfectly complement the narratives energy and emotion.Emilia Perez is a powerful and poignant film that celebrates the courage to embrace ones true self, regardless of societal expectations or the consequences.

,"Is not that bad, but there are issues.","Ok, I want to start by emphasizing that I am Latina-not Mexican, but Latina. I dont think its a bad movie; I really liked Zoe Saldañas performance and Karla Gascóns as well. We can discuss whether this woman is racist or not, but she does act well.I understand the hate, Ive seen the memes, and its clear that theres an issue with a French production tackling a Mexican story while featuring so few Mexican actors. However, its not like what the movie portrays isnt true-disappearances, corruption, and social decay all happen.Now, whats the real problem with this film? Selena Gomez. Im sorry because I think shes a good actress, but in this case, the casting was a failure. Her poor Spanish and how forced she looks in every scene ruin it whenever she appears. If you analyze it, almost all the memes come from her scenes.Another issue is that they made it a musical. The songs are bad, and most of the cast sings terribly. They could have just made it a movie about a controversial topic without turning it into a musical.To wrap up, its not a bad movie, but its not a masterpiece worthy of 13 Oscars either. Social media keeps making things go viral, leading people to take extreme positions. My recommendation?

If it is supposed to be a fantasy, they nailed it, because I would be more inclined to believe dragons and elves exist than a homicidal drug lord deciding hes actually a mild-mannered woman on the inside.

,Emilia Perez is not for musical fans,"Emilia Perez is a film that has sparked considerable discussion due to its length and content. Many viewers feel that the movie is excessively long, with numerous filler scenes that do not contribute meaningfully to the narrative. A significant point of contention is the inclusion of extended musical numbers. Critics argue that these segments are not only poorly executed but also largely unnecessary, detracting from the overall experience, especially for fans of musicals who may have higher expectations for such performances.The plot of Emilia Perez has been described as convoluted, often requiring the audience to infer critical details without sufficient context. This ambiguity is particularly evident in the films climax, where it remains unclear whether the gangsters hired by Zoe Saldanas character or their adversaries emerge victorious. Such unresolved plot points can leave viewers feeling unsatisfied and questioning the narratives coherence.Beyond these specific critiques, the film has been the subject of broader discussions in the media. For instance, an article in The Cut examines the portrayal of transgender women in Emilia Perez, suggesting that the film offers a dated perspective that may not resonate with contemporary audiences.Additionally, a review in the Miami New Times goes so far as to label the film a disaster, criticizing it as not only the worst film of the year but also as a vicious insult to both transgender individuals and the nation of Mexico.These critiques highlight the films controversial reception and the varied responses it has elicited from audiences and critics alike.In summary, Emilia Perez has been met with mixed reactions, with particular criticism directed at its length, unnecessary filler material, and ambiguous plot developments. The extended musical interludes have been singled out as poorly performed and superfluous, potentially alienating musical enthusiasts. The films demand for audience inference, especially regarding critical plot outcomes, further contributes to its contentious reception.",7,3,40,-0.027551834130781497,0.5358652312599681

The festivals and the critics have been bought, its obvious.When you make a musical and all your singers sing badly and the music is cheap, when you take a subject as serious as the disappearances of human beings by Mexican cartels and gender conversion and you make a funny choreography where they sing about sex change procedures and prices, when you decide to make songs in Spanish with people who dont speak Spanish and you dont even check if the phrases make sense, you are not taking your job or the cinema seriously at all.

,Thought provoking,"Emilia Pérez is a groundbreaking cinematic experience that defies traditional storytelling, blending genres with audacious creativity. This musical drama explores complex themes of identity, redemption, and transformation through a unique lens of magical realism. Director Jacques Audiard crafts an extraordinary narrative about a transgender cartel leader seeking personal reinvention, told through sixteen riveting musical numbers that pulse with energy and innovation. The film masterfully navigates between crime thriller, musical, and social commentary, creating a genre-bending experience that is simultaneously heartfelt and provocative. Zoe Saldaña delivers a phenomenal performance as Rita, the lawyer who becomes integral to Emilias journey. The films bold visual style and unexpected musical interludes transform what could be a conventional story into something truly remarkable. Its What sets Emilia Pérez apart is its fearless approach to storytelling. It tackles serious subjects like Mexicos drug wars and gender transition with sensitivity, humor, and extraordinary artistic vision.

,"Unusual musical, in a good way","Zoe blew me away, and I loved Karla, both deserve recognition. While its an Emilia story, it was Zoe that carried this film, somehow she is the film and her Zoes performance carried it. Its about time that two lead actresses get recognized in leading roles, if we want to talk about equality, we should move away from only recognizing that the lead should always be from opposite genders, any movie that has a female lead gets my attention, with this film, which has two female leads, I was hooked.I just hoped that some of the songs had the wow factor, at least one of them should have, but unfortunately none of them did. Its definitely a new take on musicals and thats good, appreciate this approach and would love to see more experimenting in this direction.Bingo!",6,3,40,0.16344696969696967,0.5573232323232323
,No one involved in making the movie really cares about what it pretends to say,"The plot: there is no story, there is no learning, no character arc. Manitas starts as an evil drug lord and murderer and magically transforms into Emilia, a wonderful, generous woman who just wants to help her community, take care of her children, and find true love. The most we hear her talk about the ridiculousness of her situation is when she tells her lawyer that she regrets some things. We never get to see her suffer and learn from her past horrible self. We never get to see anyone trying to get revenge. She only suffers because her ex-wife wants her money back, but for reasons unrelated to her past crimes. But, but, but, in the end, she turns into a martyr, and they make a statue of her and the whole town march venerating her! So incredibly disrespectful and tone-deaf.The music: just horrible. The songs arent interesting musically, there is a lot of autotune, and the voices dont match the performances. There are weird sexual connotations in a song about corruption , the lyrics dont match the rhythm and dont make sense sometimes , there are weird word choices that no one would say, and the accents in some words dont go with the flow of the song. The songs dont help the plot to advance, and some songs are really out of place and dont go anywhere .The acting: the film is entirely based on Mexico but they didnt bother to get real Mexican actresses for the main roles. I get that Jessica is not from Mexico , but it is really clear that she doesnt even know how to form a phrase. She uses weird slang that not even a native would use, and sometimes I couldnt even understand what she was saying. Having lived years in Mexico with her Mexican husband, children, and lover, one would assume she speaks at least at an A1 level... but no. And, although the other main characters have good spanish, neither of them have mexican accent. Weird.The cultural references: The very first frame in the movie is three mariachis with sombreros and lights floating in space. We never get to listen to them; they dont have any reason to be there; they arent part of the plot. Just so you know that this is a movie about Mexico! You get it? Mariachis! Thats the most Mexican thing! Right? And the surface-level treatment of the drugs and violence problem in Mexico, all reduced to a banal and meaningless plot where the most evil and guilty are elevated to literally god-level because now they are soooo good! Awful, disgusting.I could go on, but I think everything is already said by others.The fact that this received not 1, not 2, but 13 Oscar nominations is an insult. Not just to Mexico, but to all of Latin America, the film industry, and everyone who truly values cinema and art.",1,16,0,0.0015685738581146648,0.5184159378036929
,It was something so raw and emotional,"Emilia Perezs 2024 movie is an absolute emotional rollercoaster, and Im still trying to catch my breath after it. From the first scene to the last, its raw, real, and deeply moving. The film captures something so personal, it almost feels like youre right there, living through the emotions with the characters.Zoe Saldanas performance? Wow. She completely transforms into her character, pouring her heart and soul into every moment. I honestly think this is one of her best performances to date.I have to mention how perfectly each song fits the scenes. Its not just background noise-it amplifies the emotions of the moment.What really stands out in this movie is how unapologetically raw it is.

,Rich in contents yet lacking in depth,"I would say its a pretty good film as for a number of reasons.First, for its originality and creativity. Of all those movies that Ive gone through, Ive never come across anything that resembles this one in particular. Its always exciting to start a brand new chapter and Emilia Perez definitely offers that unique experience. Second, for its wide coverage of themes. Emilia Perez is the movie that gets to combine pretty much all assortment of topics into just one. I felt like going through a roller coaster ride of all these different emotions and was overwhelmed by how abundant the film itself was. It was just, a lot. Music, dance, crime, trans... you name it.Third, for the outstanding performance of the actresses. I already had high expectations for this film before because of the fact that four main characters from Emilia Perez shared the honor of Best Actress Cannes 2024. And surely they did! Brilliant acting!However, there were just some scenes that I couldnt get my head around and found that a bit disappointing.As much as how affluent of the wide range the film had involved, it also spreads itself way too thin. There were so many times that I thought the story would develop this way but all of sudden it just went into the other direction and never headed back...) It juggles too many topics but does not deeply explore any of them, leaving the film a bit more vacant compared to its over-packed contents. I guess that is the reason why Emilia Perez fails to create a lasting emotional impact on me...But overall, I think it is definitely worth watching.",7,3,40,0.2244199134199134,0.500002886002886
,Don't watch this movie,"I have to be honest-Emilia Pérez just isnt a good film. Its far from the worst thing ever made, but its disjointed storytelling, painfully awkward dialogue, and blatant disregard for internal consistency make it feel like a forgettable streaming release rather than a serious cinematic effort. A prime example of the weak writing? At one point, a character says Bienvenido , when they clearly meant Youre welcome . Its as if the script was originally written in French and then run through an online translator.

The main character is a trans lesbian. It wasnt about the trans community or a social commentary about them, the transformation was more like a lifestyle/personality transformation here with gender change twisted into it.Musical, dark, interesting, emotional, cool, well-made, independent, touching, inspiring, different, fresh, unique memorable.Why choosing such a character for defending the rights of the people to choose their identity and sexuality; it was a question that was in my mind but it was answered throughout the film when it progressed, it was mainly a metaphor for desiring for change in the lifestyle.Some of the scenes were exaggerated and felt too much.Good direction.

,7,"I have mixed feelings about Emilia Pérez. Theres much to celebrate about the story, particularly its focus on a transgender woman as the main character. The film also shows critical issues like the narco-war, the crisis of disappearances in Mexico, and pervasive violence.However, the narrative feels somewhat disjointed, lacking a clear, cohesive storyline. Then theres the music. I know musicals are supposed to lean into the theatrical, but the songs here just didnt work for me. They didnt rhyme, which made them feel a little awkward, and the singing wasnt great either. Instead of adding to the story or pulling me deeper into the emotions, the songs felt more like a distraction.At the end of the day, I cant say I loved Emilia Pérez, but I do respect what it was trying to do.",7,3,41,0.15381944444444445,0.4875

,"Bonkers brilliant, but maybe not for everyone.","Netflix is screening Jacques Audiards unique movie and while it is clearly not a universal hit Im fanboying it.I mean, its bonkers. A musical about the Mexican cartels, the loss of 100,000 Mexican citizens since 1960, vaginoplasty and a four way relationship between four women .Gascon starts the movie as a man who loves his young family and his beautiful wife Jessi . He is deeply unhappy with his life, despite the love of his family and his outrageous wealth, and desires his real dream - to become a woman. So he hires a disgruntled female lawyer, Rita, to find the best sex change surgeon in the world, manage his transition, fake his death and hide his family.Cue a remarkable vaginoplasty song.

Her new identity leads to happiness as it turns out, although that soon becomes a challenge.The movie shape shifts throughout with some crazy song and dance numbers, some fairly extreme violence, laughs and gasps in equal measure.Its probably the most undefinable movie Ive seen since Titane and I unreservedly recommend it.",9,13,100,0.09857954545454546,0.49600919913419916
,"heartfelt, rambling, Saldana is good","Id like to rate this well-intentioned movie higher but honestly its a narrative mess. It spans far too many themes - transgenderism. Mexicos dreadful crime problem with 100,000 people disappeared, bigotry, sexism, corruption, crime and its consequences - this would have to be a miniseries to jam it all in.The lead character makes some clueless and selfish decisions, which lead directly to the outcome, yet the movie celebrates her life at the end with no apparent awareness of what the script was telling us. Just being honest, and accepting the consequences, at a crucial point would have averted it all.As for the ending, about 30 minutes from the end, characters start acting nuts without adequate setup. I suppose because its 30 minutes from the end and its time for a dynamic conclusion but I found it awkwardly written and unconvincing.On top of it all, this is the first musical Ive seen where most of the cast cant sing. And the songs are unmemorable . Imagine a bunch of people singing karaoke songs youve never heard of and dont care to even hear again.Zoe Saldana shines in her singing and dancing performances but if they werent going to hire a cast that could sing, they should have shelved the musical aspect.

,Many moments of artistic brilliance marred by mundane story in the second half.,"Compelling and unexpected, this social commentary come damning indictment of the political condition of Mexico expressed with fine acting and interesting musical moments, featuring Zoe Saldana in the role she was surely born to perform as a symbolical and later active representative of the plight of Mexican women particularly, moves along at fast and attention-commanding pace for the first hour, with many tension-filled moments resolved satisfyingly, to what feels like the natural conclusion of the storyline - and then proceeds to fall apart. There were so many other ways in which this tale might have been told and unfolded which would have made more psychological sense, and been more gratifying; instead, it ultimately meanders into the mundane of unchecked emotions, stupid choices, and generic glamorized violence. The hard-won awareness of the titular character, portrayed so charismatically by Karla Sofia Gascon, suddenly slips entirely out of her grasp, with disastrous consequences. Personally, I was disappointed by the absence of any educating of Emilia by Rita about the realities of what society requires or expects and anticipates of female behaviour, which was touched on only momentarily when Rita compliments Emilia and is offended by the fact that it never occurred to Emilia to compliment her in return. In other words, the reality that the gender of the body we inhabit changes the way we move through the world, because of the worlds response to it/us.

,A Superficial and Offensive Portrayal of Mexico,"As a Mexican, I find this movie deeply disrespectful to my culture. The way it addresses the issue of missing persons is insensitive, lacking any tact, and worst of all, accompanied by absurd songs that trivialize one of the most painful tragedies in our country. I cant help but think about the mothers of the disappeared watching this film and wondering how they would feel seeing such a shallow take on their suffering.The portrayal of drug trafficking is just as problematic. The film turns a character into a good person just because they change their gender, which is not only an extreme oversimplification but also seems to justify one of the greatest evils in a shallow way. Moreover, the idea that campaigns to find the missing are funded by organized crime itself is an offensive mockery of those who tirelessly seek justice in Mexico.Even more infuriating is how the movie depicts the discovery of missing persons, as if it were something simple, when in reality, thousands of families in our country are still desperately searching for answers. Presenting it in this way feels like a slap in the face to those who endure the pain of an endless search.In conclusion, this film not only uses Mexico as a convenient backdrop but also reduces it to a stereotype that fits the idea of a redeemed criminal, showing no respect for the complexity of the issues it attempts to tackle. I do not recommend watching it if youre Mexican. If youre a foreigner, go ahead and judge it for yourself, but keep in mind that the reality of our country is far harsher and more complex than what is shown here.",1,30,2,-0.08580246913580244,0.5891534391534393
,It's okay.,"I watched this alongside the other award nominees as Im a voting member and during the course of the film I veered between this is brilliant to this is dumb. But its only at a films conclusion that you can really get a sense of how good it is overall.Addressing the criticism I would point out that Selena Gomezs character is meant to be Mexican- American not Mexican. This film is also SET IN Mexico not a film about Mexican culture. While that doesnt make the representations better, the context does challenge those particular criticisms about accent and culture.For the film itself, it is well made for what it is, the acting is strong, particularly Zoe Saldana who is terrific. The songs are kind of weird but theyre also catchy. The story is confusing in many ways with lack of clarity about what its trying to say. How does the character change after transitioning? There are sometimes hints of Manitas in Emilias behavior towards the end but its not explained clearly how someone goes from being a cold blooded cartel leader to someone running a charitable organization focused on restorative justice. Are they suggesting that being outside of the cartel system allows someone to feel compassion or are they suggesting that gender confirming surgery does this because if its the latter that is an odd position. If its the former they needed to show that more clearly.There were great scenes particularly when Karla Zoe meet in London. That was very moving and when Karla and Selena are talking about her marriage to Manitas.But overall I found it to be a little sloppy, as many films about women that are directed by men tend to be with missed opportunities and overly dramatic female characterization.Selena Gomez goes a good job here even if her accent was simple enough for me to understand but she wasnt given much to work with. Shown mostly as a flighty woman with carnal desires.To summarize, I say it is a film featuring women but its not really great representation of the experience be of being female. Similarly, this a melodrama SET in Mexico not a Mexican film or a film about Mexican culture. It honestly could have equally been set in Colombia or Venezuela or Honduras.Its a passable film, I doubt I would watch it again. There are much better Spanish language films, better films with female leads but its a reasonable watch so check it out for yourself.",,1,7,0.1168939393939394,0.4154329004329006
,Jacques Audiard,"It may strike the viewer as a rather perplexing film... Emilia Pérez, which deals with themes of atonement, acceptance, family, injustice, and betrayal, while also standing out with its magnificent choreography and music, brought the award for best actress to all four leading actresses at Cannes, and became one of the rare films to win two awards at once in the main competition... Which, for my part, I saw as a rather political and populist move, Cannes is now but an awards ceremony surrendered to such actions... Such absurd actions create a negative effect for films.The quality of the director and the talents of the actors are reflected in the film in every aspect; I am one who already loves the cinema of Jacques Audiard, and have always admired Zoe Saldana, so the film already had a 2-point advantage with me.The film is quite a hodgepodge, a French director, an American cast, a transgender individual, and cartels... The fact that it is a musical was a most unexpected move, for as Jacques Audiard reiterated in interviews at the films premiere, he does not care for musical films at all.In short; Emilia Pérez is a production that some viewers may find difficult to digest, but the taste it leaves on the palate will linger for a long time.",7,3,44,0.12583333333333332,0.45166666666666666

I actually felt remorse for the actors who took these roles and wished I could pull them off the screen and tell them its going to be okay. We will give you a commiserations Oscar and hope the world forgets they have eyes. There were multiple scenes throughout this film where I certainly wished I didnt have ears.The genre should be changed to Horror. If it was, perhaps I would be more inclined to give it more than 1 star.The concept isnt actually terrible but the singing certainly is. Making this film into a musical feels like a last minute fumbled decision. The acting by Zoe was okay but overall it seemed like no one elses heart was in it.

,Indifferent,"Now Im thinking about watching a marathon of this years Oscar-nominated films, excluding The Brutalist and Dune 2, which I already saw at their premiere. And considering the various options I had, I have chosen to delve into this strange project.Ive heard about this movie over the past few months but had no intention of seeing it. I saw that there was a great diversity of opinions between critics, the public and vice versa about the plot and where it was developed. The idea that a Mexican drug trafficker wants to fulfill his dream of wanting to be a woman and live a different life based on various choreographies that take advantage of sending a message against the corrupt system in which his own country is subjected, and also messages related to the plot itself, seems to me to be a very risky proposal.As I watched the final credits of the movie roll I was thinking what grade I was going to give it, and while I was doing that there was a deep part inside me wondering: What the hell did I just see?. The musical parts seemed to me to come out in a forced and sudden way. The argument, if you think about it coldly , is a bit absurd. Since the first scene I have not felt so involved in the story it is about. It is true that there have been scenes that are emotional and that have made me feel empathy towards the characters, but when they start singing and dancing I feel like I cannot fully submit to the scene. It leaves me cold.What impressed me the most is Saldañas performance. I had not seen her before as explosive and lively as here. He gets fully into the character from the first minute, having very good choreography . Karla Sofía Gascón and Selena Gómez are also splendid but Saldañas interpretation is far below.With this recent controversy caused by the statements of the director, Jacques Audiard, and the offensive messages from several years ago by Karla Sofía, it seems that it is most likely that Emilia Pérez will not win any Academy Award, being the one with the most nominations at this years gala. There is also the problem of the directors own conception of capturing such a delicate topic, the drug trafficking that spreads through that area, in a premise with romantic and sweetened touches.I am not a supporter of Audiards statements but I can debate Gascóns messages. But, well, Ill leave it there.I do think its a shame that he doesnt take some merit even though Im not entirely convinced. But I would be fine if Saldaña took the award for best supporting actress.Its not a movie that blew my mind. Ive thought about it throughout the day and I definitely think it wasnt that memorable of an experience. It is an entertaining and very strange film at the same time, and that strangeness makes me feel cold and without any emotion too strong to want to say that I had a really good time.

It felt like the director didnt bother to learn more about this conflict, which is a huge disservice to the real-life tragedies that deserve thoughtful and respectful portrayal. The films attempt to make a musical out of such a delicate subject just didnt sit well with me at all.Zoe Saldaña has definitely delivered better performances, and Selena Gómez was just plain awful in this.",2,23,1,0.05119047619047619,0.5306547619047619
,Audience,"To be honest, I dont really like musical movies, but I really liked this movie, especially the scenes of Zoe and Karla and the music show were perfect. Selena had a small number of scenes, but despite this, I think her scenes were quite successful. The film, which meets with action at first, then turns into comedy and love, drama and reckoning scenes are included towards the last scenes. The movie was very smooth, the music and dancing were very beautifulspoilers!!!Emilia Perez is a musical crime film that embodies themes such as sexual identity, forgiveness, love, family. Although she is quite successful in her profession, we are dragged into an unusual story with the introduction of Rita, a criminal lawyer who is overshadowed by other employees at the law firm where she works, and Mexicos famous cartel leader Manitas. Manitas hires Rita, who although she does not shine under the stage lights, realizes her true potential, to help her achieve the life she has been dreaming of for years and get rid of the burden of her past.Manitas, who hired Rita for gender reassignment surgery, offers her a big enough sum of money to build her life from scratch. In fact, it is more of a duty than an offer, because in the world where Manitas belongs, listening means accepting. Apart from the surgical procedures, Ritas task is to organize the fake death of Manitas and the creation of a new life for his wife Jessi and their children in Switzerland. After a brisk flow of Rita traveling the world looking for a doctor for Manitas, we finally meet Emilia Perez, who gave the film its name, witnessing the transformation of Manitas.After both characters have rebuilt their lives, they meet non-coincidentally years later at a crowded table. While Emilia asks Rita for help again to get back to the longed-for parts of her life that she left behind, we begin the search for justice and identity with the friendship that develops between the two.",10,17,147,0.17246928746928744,0.5246723996723996
,Sicario the mushy mainstream way,"Emilia Pérez is a co-production between France, Belgium, Mexico and the United States of America that was released in 2024 and is almost completely in the Spanish language. You will hear maybe five lines of English too. France being listed as the first production country has to do with director Jacques Audiard who is also one of the three writers here. Number two is Thomas Bidegain with whom Audiard has worked in the past too and number three is Léa Mysius, a filmmaker in her own right as well. You can say that for Audiard this film here that runs for easily over two hours is the biggest awards show statement from his career or at least mainstream awards show statement. He has gotten in at the Oscars before, but that was only in the foreign-language film category. The Oscar nominations are not out yet for this year, but 11 BAFTA nominations says it all. Add to that the success at the European Film Awards, Cannes and other events already, even if I must say that with Cannes I am not a fan of handing Best Actress awards to multiple performers. They should include an ensemble category then instead. More recently, the movie also won pretty big at the Golden Globes taking home two film awards and this included the big trophy for musical/comedy. Well, it is by no means a comedy and the only somewhat funny thing was Saldanas character looking at Emilia when she sees her children again and hoping that Gomezs character does not realize what is happening. The third Golden Globe went to Zoe Saldana for her performance. She is also the one to beat now in the supporting category when it comes to the Oscars. Difficult to say if there is somebody who might. It seems unlikely. It is tough for me to see her as supporting here though. She is a lot in the movie in the first half, then it gets less, but she returns for crucial segments again and is also present in the spectacular finale. Maybe people forgot during the watch how much screen time she had early on long before the title character entered the picture. This probably also helped with her being seen as supporting that the film is named after another character. You can say in favor of the decision that the film probably would have worked without Saldanas character, but not without Emilia Pérez.So two of Saldanas fellow nominees at the Oscars could be Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez, so yeah the young ones are definitely closing the gap, but it also makes it obvious that Saldana is not facing the strongest opposition ever in this category. Her win, if it happens, would also one of the weaker in recent history. She was not bad or anything, but I still think a nomination for her would already be too much. I would say the same about the other cast members. Karla Sofia Gascón, who plays the title character, will 100% be nominated for an Oscar, already for the historic aspect of having a woman nominated that was born a man. I dont really care about that. The performance matters more. And while it was solid, I would also not use any superlatives here as others have. Same level like Saldana perhaps. The one thing I do have respect for, however, is that she also played her character before the transition. I liked how she acted as a male in the first third of the film, even if one could surely ask if it is really such a good idea if you just had this kind of surgery to play a big character in a film instead of staying yourself for a while and exploring your new life without the public eye. So I would maybe nominate Gascon in supporting for the first 40 minutes only. Eventually Selena Gomez gets the same words from me about her performance: Good, but not good enough for an Oscar nomination. Still, also if you look at her television career now, she has really made it far compared to many other young starlets from her generation. Who would have guessed she may be the one from the trio Steve Martin and Martin Short who gets the Oscar nomination. She is far from a shoo-in. We will see how it goes.As for the film we have here, you can divide it into three chapters really. It also fits time-wise that they all are almost equally long. The first is everything about Saldana and the introduction to Gascón and her character pre-op. Then there is a really big jump ahead in time and we find out about Emilias new life, how it is working out nicely but still she misses her family and the children do become a part of her life eventually and it is even more harmonic. The final chapter then is typical Audiard. Much more tense away from the subjects Hollywood adores so much and this is where the film became really gritty and the aspect of crime and violence was included for the first time really. Characters are beaten up, blackmailed, abducted, cut-off fingers being sent via mail, huge shootouts with automatic rifles, exploding cars etc. I honestly wish the film could have been like this from the start, but oh well. Until this last chapter I thought I would have to give it an even lower rating and thus a negative recommendation, but the final 45 minutes or even more had me on the edge of my seat here and there and this is why I still give the film a positive recommendation, even if all the awards recognition it receives is extremely exaggerated. I am also not happy with the decision to turn it into a musical. There were hardly any performances I liked. I mean I am generally not big on dance choreographies, so this is probably just me, but I do appreciate many songs in general and I saw not really such level in here. Selena Gomezs song from her showy moment was fine. I think it was the same song that also played during the closing credits , but this is it. Gascóns numbers were so-so, better early on and Saldanas were another step down in quality. That one of those seems to win the Oscar for Best Song this year is downright sad.As for some of the smaller characters, they clearly cast people there with decent singing voices because their acting did not have to be great as they did not have much to work with anyway, but the one time they start singing should elevate the movie and often it did. This probably also applies to Adriana Paz. She was the title characters love interest, but yeah we find out nothing about her really and hardly know anything about who she is. The moment how the two were bonding over being armed just in case during their first meeting was a bit funny though. The gun eventually did not help Emilia a lot when it mattered. Even if the last scenes were spectacular, there were also a few things wrong to me with how it all unfolded. I did not like the way Gomezs character was written there. I mean she made herself very clear before that that she is really totally crazy over her new man and that she always carried a fear that her old man would find and kill her plus he attacked her new man, wants to take her kids from her etc. So I find it difficult to believe that she changes her mind so quickly and refinds all these loyalties when she realizes who Emilia is. I also did not like that Saldanas character is around all of a sudden and watches the explosion of the car. Before that it was still a decent moment as we knew something was about to happen when we see the vehicle right after the crash. Audiard already played with us a bit implying that Emilia could die a few moments earlier, but she does not. In the end, there is no getting out/away for her though.This aforementioned criticism linked to Gomezs character also had to do with the fact that while she turned into a bit of an antagonist eventually, they wanted to make sure that we see her still as a somewhat decent person at least. Edgar Ramírez was supposed to be seen as the bad guy, also with the earlier comments by Emilia about him. What a waste though! Ramírez is such a talented actor and he was not allowed to show us anything. There is also major misandry in this movie. Look at the hotshot lawyer at the very beginning, look at the doctor who does the job, but is certainly not really on the tolerant side. Saldanas characters moment when she objects to what he says was supposed to be seen as one of the most powerful, but I found it a bit cringeworthy and staged. Even Emilia pre-op was a ruthless criminal and seemed to have softened up then as a female, even if admittedly during his/her talk with Saldanas character in the first third of the film, the character was already a bit soothing and tells her that she does not need t be scared. Well, not entirely true. Of course, she needs to be scared if she knows about the plan and refuses to assist. No witnesses I guess. And there is of course also the covered heads thingey before entering the car, so nobody knows about the location, but this is really just a common modus operandi and nothing personal or truly against any of the character. More like business procedure. I guess this is pretty much it then. As you may have understood by now from what wrote, I think this was an alright movie that got kinda saved during the final 45 minutes where it got bolder and more interesting. Before that, it was pretty much a movie that delivered the agenda that liberal Hollywood loves, but in terms of actual creativity, great writing and memorability it came mostly short. Maybe three stars out of five is still a bit on the generous side here and I would not have given as much if the first third had been this good and everything afterwards rather forgettable. But yeah, it is what it is and I give Emilia Pérez a positive recommendation. Without enthusiasm, however.",6,2,28,0.11904358713182238,0.45781917725768

But in a good way! I loved not being able to guess what was going to happen next! Can we be redeemed? Can we atone for past mistakes? Do we deserve that love?

Its true that Selenas spanish isnt good but it fits with her character as an american and her performance is undeniable tragically good. A deep and so dramatic performance. In music matter Gascon is the mmmm, she didnt achieve what a musical in fact needs, vocal quality. She needs to train her voice a lot. In general an original movie in visual as much as musical.

,On operatic ride from Jacques Audiard,"EMILIA PEREZ Jacques Audiards operatic EMILIA PEREZ is a wild ride that combines Neo-Noir, Telenovelas and Musicals in adapting his own Libretto .

,"Honestly, pretty great.","Really thought this movie was going to suck so bad based what Ive seen on Twitter, but I genuinely enjoyed it. Dont understand why so many people are pissed about the best picture nomination when, in the previous years, you have shit like Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody nominated for Best Picture which were significantly worse than this. Not really sure if its just transphobic people hating on this or that people have only seen certain scenes out of context that generated the hate for this film, but I thought it was solid.The vaginoplastia song was kinda goofy but there are a lot of songs that are actual foot stomping bangers too. My main complaint about the songs is that the transition into song and dance sometimes feel like they erupt out of nowhere, but when the incredible cinematography and choreography starts happening, who cares? Theres also this one song in the middle of the film from the son about how Emilia smells like his papa, which was an amazing scene and was genuinely emotional. Im glad to see Gascon getting nominated for best actress .The pacing of the film does start to drag on a bit. Things just seem to happen for the sake of happening and the transition from scene to scene felt awkward and unwarranted. The ending also felt a little rushed and I wish there was more of a conclusion.There might be some valid criticisms regarding the portrayal of Mexican culture and Im not well-equipped to tackle that as an Asian dude who has never been to or experienced Mexico. Overall, I still enjoyed the film quite a bit and really liked the framing of the story. Oh yeah, the sound design throughout the film was also great!",7,1,16,0.19379960317460318,0.5249393738977072

The songs are forgettable, and the singing lacks power, though the choreography manages to stand out. The third act stumbles, delivering a conclusion that feels rushed and uninspired.

The musical interludes didnt work and felt unsubtle, the underrated London Road did this much better to a more chilling extreme and expanded the character development, here it felt contrived and foolish.

,"It Should Have Been Titled As ""Rita Mora Castro""...","Above all Emilia Perez was the most way-out musical I have ever seen. Jacques Audiard definitely brought a new and fresh take on musical story-telling with this movie which is not %100 musical by the way. I wasnt expecting to see this much effort put into one movie as if it was a well structured stage performance. The story was quite engaging and well-paced until the very end. It almost felt like music was always there even in dialogues without any instruments, the raw performances also enhanced the story-telling so much. I mean, think of making a musical with pro-singers and also with people who are not even voice-trained or have any talent in singing. This made the story look so real. Some musical parts were quite touching especially for having such strong lyrics. In such an exciting way, Emilia Perez or Manitas was not the only character that transformed, all main characters evolved into their better versions throughout the film.Zoe Saldana, wow, I have never expected from her to act so smooth, to sing and to dance so good. The charity ball dance was amazing. I think this movie will be remembered as one of her best acting performances. I understand her character being the MC and the key element, a bridge in between all characters BUT... lets get to that a little later... It was my first time seeing Karla Sofía Gascón in a movie and I cant imagine how it must have felt for her to act in this movie. She conveyed all those mixed emotions of such a complicated character so well to the viewer. I have never met or talked with a trans person so I really dont know if its possible to become someone else entirely OR you just have to carry both versions of yourself inside, replacing the other in time. I felt like the second in this movie as Emilia seemed to be connected in both identities regardless of the sex-change operation. And the uncanny resemblance of her to the Turkish fashion designer Barbaros Sansal made me smile a bit :) I hope Sansal watches this movie and has his own What If momentSelena Gomez was again acting boldly , the chemistry between her character and Edgar Ramirezs bad daddy character was also quite unique. There was no bad acting in the entire movie and they were all very soulful.The cultural and historical background of the movie was heavy with the harsh reality of crimes and killing of innocent people, but the movie didnt exploit these themes in order to give a message. But Im sure it helped connecting with the viewers a lot and turn the story into a memorable experience.And now some of the bad parts... The openning of the movie was too complicated and distracting. For the first 15 minutes, I believed that I was going to hate this movie so much because I didnt enjoy the speed, the crowd, the lyrics and the choreography at all. But maybe it was an artistic choice for Jacques Audiard, to reflect the tension like the birth of all the characters. The music style shimmied its way through the entire movie, which sounded sometimes so close to Broadway and sometimes a pop concert, it had extreme highs and extreme lows which felt like some parts were just fill-ins... Some bad singing too but as I explained above, it just added to the reality concept, and I liked that. I wish there were also more extravagant, larger than life elements as the set design, or the costumes, which could really match with the soul of a musical yet they were quite ordinary. Maybe it was skipped on purpose not to make the story look artificial. I dont want to spoil the ending, but it was quite predictable and I asked to myself, was that really necessary to go that far...And although I loved seeing Zoe Saldana all along, this movie was not named Rita Mora Castro if this was her story then why not?... And regarding her latest Golden Globes award for Best Supporting Actress, I think due to her screen time on this movie, she could snatch Demi Moores award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture instead.

They were clearly trying to tell an edgy story through a faux musical format. I give them one star for ambition and one each for Saldana and Gascon but nothing more. Its hard to understand why this film is garnering awards apart from the fact that it focuses on the journey of a trans character, which has been done much better elsewhere on cable and streamers.Worse line in a 21st century movie: The drug boss, approached by a survivor of a victim of a massacres : When she kissed my hand, I felt her tears, and for the first time I loved myself.Yeah, thats right lady, its all about you.

Karla Sofía Gascón, whether you like her or not, in my opinion, did quite well as she conveyed that intentional discomfort in the film! I felt sorry for Selena Gomez, I like her, but this movie didnt favor her, although her effort is visible.

,An unusual use of the musical and a pleasing intro to a trans life.,"Emilia Perez has arrived-film and character, both feted by the Golden Globe Awards and a certainty for Oscar nominations. Partly comedy, partly musical, and fully thriller set in Mexico by a French director, Jacques Audiard, it is an entertaining hybrid that, like The Crying Game, holds riches while it explores a trans subject with care and sensitivity.Character Emilia/Manitas , a kingpin drug lord, hires attorney Rita to help her get a sex change. The thriller aspect is ready made as Manitas bloody past cannot be expunged even with the change. Attending physician Wasserman tells Rita he can change the body but not the soul.Woven into the drama of the trans activity is a series of songs, some unusually light such as gender reallocation patients singing about vaginoplasty and mammoplasty, with a distinct echo of Pedro Almodovors humor amidst out-there sexuality. Some aud may complain about the abrupt tonal changes such interruptions bring, but that seems to be Audiards purpose in disrupting our normal lives.More surprising is to see the change that comes over the trans Emilia, whose life after becomes dedicated to charitably finding lost people, some of whom she was responsible for murdering as Manitas.Emilia Perez is a cornucopia of motifs celebrating dynamic, diversifying modern life. Watch for it at Oscar time. On Netflix, free with subscription.",,1,18,0.09128787878787879,0.49772727272727285

Zoe Saldanas performance is exceptional-she brings a powerful presence to her role, layering it with emotion and authenticity.

The story lacked depth, the characters felt poorly developed, and the overall execution seemed rushed and uninspired. Instead of being engaging or thought-provoking, it felt like a waste of time. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone. There are far better ways to spend your time than watching something that doesnt offer quality, entertainment, or even basic coherence. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one.The situations often come across as distastefully comedic, and the singing is subpar, with only a few exceptions.",1,34,3,3.469446951953614e-18,0.5578124999999999

The story is very intense and somewhat dark so when they transition to the musical numbers it just feels off and frankly sometimes the actors dont really sing or when they do they dont sing very well. Also, some of music is cheesy, especially the song about the gender transition towards the beginning. The only actor who was effective was Zoe Saldana. Shes a very good singer it turns out and a solid actress. Her performance is somewhat overshadowed by the poor pacing and tone issues unfortunately but she deserves the awards shell probably win for this. This would have worked so much better without the musical numbers. The story is kind of a downer and the main title character is pretty selfish throughout the film.",6,0,13,0.1493939393939394,0.6127272727272728

The problem is the execution. Especially why this was made into a musical, but then you cast actors and actresses that cant sing too well. And the one professional singer that is cast, Selena Gomez, does a horrible job.To their credit, Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón do a great job with the material. Its Selena Gomez that stands out like a sore thumb with her bad spanglish. Shes publicly admitted that her Spanish isnt fluent or even good. Why was she cast?The movie is too long and as it couldve told its story with a shorter runtime. It sags in the middle and becomes a bit slow and boring as Saldañas character disappears into the background. She really carries the film and deserves the accolades she gets for this.And then you learn, as I mention in the title, that this was filmed almost entirely in France with mostly non-Mexican actors and actresses, and you can see why many Mexicans are offended by this film.I get what they were trying to do with this film and I applaud them for it as far as a good idea and plot, but lands badly and feels unforgettable afterwards.",6,0,18,0.06916666666666667,0.5360416666666667

But lets ignore accents and pronunciation for a while, my biggest question is what was the point of making the project based in Mexico? Like, the central plot about Manitas transition from man to woman is an interesting idea that couldve easily been based in any other country, why making it about Mexico if the director didnt have a Mexican writer/lead/consultant Did he feel there are no gangs and crime in Europe? Why making a comedy about a theme, language and culture you know nothing about? For me, the biggest fail of this project was to make it about Mexico. Definitely pointless. Not worth the watch.

Despite its runtime of over two hours, there was never a dull moment. Its an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. The acting is incredible, truly masterful.

Likewise here, behind the caring and gentle Emilia Pérez , who helps the families of the disappeared, the shadow of the brutal Manitas del Monte can be seen furtively in a look, in a manner.

,YOU WILL BE SHOCKED,"Emilia Pérez is an exceptional film that blends crime, drama, and musical elements in a way that feels entirely fresh and captivating. Directed by the acclaimed Jacques Audiard, the film stands out for its bold storytelling, which is elevated by the performances of a remarkable ensemble cast, including Karla Sofía Gascón, Selena Gomez, and Adriana Paz. Each actress brings a unique depth to her character, contributing to the films success both critically and with audiences.Karla Sofía Gascón gives a standout performance in the titular role of Emilia Pérez. Known for her powerful work in both film and television, Gascón brings an extraordinary level of authenticity to the character of Emilia, a transgender woman who navigates both the violent world of crime and her personal journey of self-discovery. Critics have been effusive in their praise of Gascóns portrayal, noting her nuanced approach to a complex character. Her ability to embody both strength and vulnerability at once is one of the films most compelling aspects. Gascóns portrayal of Emilia offers a rare and necessary perspective, showing the challenges and resilience of a transgender woman in a world that often seeks to marginalize her. The actresss previous work, including her landmark win as the first transgender woman to receive a Best Actress award at Cannes, has positioned her as a rising star in the international film scene. Emilia Pérez further solidifies her place as one of the most exciting and talented actresses working today. The critics have noted that Gascóns performance provides the emotional core of the film, making the characters journey one that viewers can deeply connect with.Selena Gomez, known primarily for her work in television and music, surprises audiences with a deeply moving and grounded performance as Jessi, Emilias wife. Known for her roles in Wizards of Waverly Place and her music career, Gomezs portrayal of Jessi adds a layer of emotional weight to the film, especially as the character navigates the pain of loss and the eventual realization of the lies shes been told. Critics have praised Gomez for stepping out of her comfort zone and taking on a role that is not only more mature but also emotionally complex. The performance has been noted for its authenticity, as she manages to infuse the character with both warmth and heartbreak. Jessi is a woman caught between two worlds-the past she shared with Manitas, Emilias former identity, and the woman she has come to be. Gomezs chemistry with Gascón brings this tension to life beautifully. Her portrayal adds emotional depth to the film, ensuring that Jessi is never a secondary character but rather an integral part of the narrative. For many viewers, this performance proves that Gomez has the range to succeed in roles that showcase her dramatic capabilities.Adriana Paz plays the role of Epifiana, one of the victims of the cartel that Emilia has to confront in her quest for redemption. Pazs portrayal of Epifiana adds complexity to the film, as she brings a strong presence that challenges both Emilia and the audiences understanding of morality and revenge. Known for her versatile performances in Mexican cinema, Paz brings a fierce intensity to Epifiana, making her one of the most memorable characters in the film. Her work is often marked by a sharp vulnerability that allows her to connect with the audience on a profound level. Critics have applauded her performance for its depth and emotional resonance, noting that Pazs character plays a crucial role in Emilias journey toward understanding and reconciliation.Jacques Audiard, the visionary director of Emilia Pérez, is no stranger to crafting intense, multilayered stories that explore complex human emotions. His previous works, such as A Prophet and Rust and Bone, have garnered critical acclaim for their gripping narratives and complex character studies. In Emilia Pérez, Audiard seamlessly weaves together the elements of crime, musical, and drama to create a rich tapestry of storytelling. His ability to balance genre conventions while offering a fresh perspective on the lives of marginalized individuals is one of the films defining qualities. Audiard has been praised for his sensitivity in handling the transgender storyline, approaching it with nuance and respect, while also exploring the films more violent and criminal aspects. Critics have noted that Audiard brings a level of sophistication and originality to the film that allows it to transcend typical genre boundaries. His direction, combined with the stellar performances from the cast, creates a film that is both entertaining and deeply moving.In conclusion, Emilia Pérez is a film that thrives because of the exceptional performances of Karla Sofía Gascón, Selena Gomez, and Adriana Paz. Each actress brings a unique perspective to her role, contributing to a multifaceted narrative that blends crime, emotional depth, and musicality. Jacques Audiards direction ties all these elements together in a seamless and inventive way, making the film a standout work in contemporary cinema.",8,4,24,0.16036585365853656,0.5497967479674796

,Brilliantly unique and engaging piece of cinema,"Out of all the films Ive seen in recent years, Emilia Perez feels like the one that is the most creatively risky. The plot alone must have been quite an interesting pitch, but throw in the fact that its a musical? Its a wonder it even got made, but Im very glad that it did.I think the various plot synopses from IMDb and other sites probably give away the big plot point, but I shant repeat it here in case youre able to go in cold. I will just say that it follows Mexico City lawyer Rita, who is enlisted by a cartel boss to execute a particularly singular task. What follows is a tale of discovery, empowerment, friendship, violence, and much more as the lives of these people intertwine and clash.From a story perspective I think this film is quite remarkable and groundbreaking. It feels so unique and is an absolute breath of fresh air. I was hooked from the start and got lost in the lives of the characters and the emotional arc I was taken on. It covers so much ground and so many different themes and handles them all so well. I also love that given the subject matter, it doesnt feel heavy handed at all. The fact that it feels organic makes it so much better.Now... as much as I adore the story of this film, was a musical the best medium for this? Probably not. Without this I think it would have worked much better. Thats not to say the musical elements are without merit. They did at times contribute to the emotion of the piece and help us to enter the minds of the characters, but some of them were also a bit jarring and bizarre. I appreciate the creative risk that was taken with this though.In terms of the performances I think they all hit the mark perfectly. Zoe Saldana, Karla Sofia Gascon and Selena Gomez as the central trio are on fire. I cant really argue with the shared Cannes film festival prize they received. The emotion that they all manage to capture is just superb.Emilia Perez is such a creative swing but it manages to pretty much knock it out of the park. The musical element hampers it slightly, but the thoroughly original and engaging story, great performances, and emotional essence of the film all make it a must watch.",8,5,35,0.25351851851851853,0.5151851851851851
,"Horrible, cannot be called cinema","Its insulting how this was approved and got made. Syou cannot understand anything on the horrible Spanish dealt by Selena, no research was made about the real context. I cannot imagine how ignorant the director and writers of this movie are. Not even the edition department should be able to watch this horrible movie one star only because I cannot give less.Heres an expanded review of the film, reaching 700 words while maintaining a critical tone:This film is an insult to both art and history. From the moment Selena graces the screen, the atrocious Spanish spoken by the actress is a jarring and offensive misrepresentation of the language. Its clear that no effort was made to ensure even a basic level of linguistic accuracy, demonstrating a profound lack of respect for the culture and heritage Selena embodied.The films narrative is riddled with historical inaccuracies and glaring omissions. The writers seem to have conducted minimal research, if any, into the nuances of Selenas life and career. Crucial aspects of her journey, her cultural impact, and the complexities of her personal and professional relationships are either grossly misrepresented or completely ignored. This superficial treatment of a significant figure in Latin music history is deeply disappointing and disrespectful to her legacy.The directors vision, or lack thereof, is equally baffling. The film lacks any artistic merit, offering a bland and uninspired visual aesthetic. The pacing is uneven, the dialogue is often clunky and contrived, and the overall tone is consistently off-key. Its as if the filmmakers were more concerned with churning out a quick and easy biopic than with crafting a meaningful and insightful cinematic experience.The acting, with the exception of a few supporting performances, is uniformly underwhelming. The lead actress, burdened with the impossible task of portraying Selena, delivers a performance that is both wooden and unconvincing. Her lack of command over the Spanish language further undermines her ability to connect with the character and convey the depth and nuance of Selenas personality.Its difficult to fathom how this film was ever greenlit for production. The sheer ignorance displayed by the filmmakers, from their disregard for linguistic accuracy to their superficial treatment of historical facts, is truly astounding. One can only imagine the level of indifference and incompetence that permeated the entire production process.Even the editing department seems to have abandoned all pretense of professionalism. The film is a chaotic mess, with jarring cuts, awkward transitions, and a general lack of cohesion. Its clear that no one involved in the post-production process cared enough to salvage this cinematic disaster.In conclusion, this film is an unmitigated disaster. Its a disrespectful and insulting portrayal of Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, a true icon of Latin music. Avoid this film at all costs. Its a waste of time and a disgrace to the memory of a remarkable artist.This expanded review maintains the critical tone while providing more specific examples of the films shortcomings. It addresses the linguistic inaccuracies, historical inaccuracies, lack of artistic merit, poor acting, and overall incompetence of the filmmakers.",1,30,3,-0.03981481481481479,0.48240740740740734
,An insult to the families and people who suffer narco in México,You cant insult and entire country like this and back yourself with the dull excuse that is an opera; what kindof excuse is that?

Also get actresses that can speak a bit Spanish would t hurt. Is unreal and bizarre that this piece of garbage is leading Oscar nominations.

,Drinking Milk While Being Lactose Intolerant Is a Better Experience Than This,"There are films that touch your soul, make you reflect on the human condition, and leave an unforgettable mark on cinema history. Emilia Perez is not one of them. In fact, if I had to choose between watching this movie again or suffering the consequences of drinking milk while being lactose intolerant, Id undoubtedly go with the latter. At least that experience offers real catharsis.The script feels like it was written with the same urgency as someone desperately looking for a restroom after a double latte. The narrative tries so hard to be deep and meaningful that it ends up drowning in its own pretension. The performances, while enthusiastic, fail to save character development that feels more forced than the smile of someone trying to hide their stomach discomfort.Visually, the film attempts to impress with its production design, but even the most elaborate effects cant disguise the lack of a compelling story. Its like decorating a gas station bathroom with chandeliers-nice on the surface, but it doesnt change the essence of the place.In conclusion, Emilia Perez is an experience that, while it might sound appealing on paper, in practice feels like a bad decision. If youre looking for a truly intense experience, I recommend drinking a glass of whole milk if youre lactose intolerant. At least that would be more genuine and memorable.",1,19,1,0.14543010752688174,0.4913978494623656
,Unlike Anything else. And that's Good.,"Emilia Perez is a film unlike any other. Directed by Jacques Audiard, it is a story of murder and love, of transition and its effects. A tale operatic both in form and substance. If at first you are put off by the cast breaking into song I ask you, Be patient. I was and I am glad that I did. The film moved me. It raised questions that are as relevant as today. I found myself without the words to adequately express my feelings when the film reached its close.Zoe Saldana is a young Latin American attorney who is summoned to meet the head of a drug cartel. He wishes to become a woman and wishes her to manage the entire effort. For this she will become wealthy beyond her dreams. This much we learn close to the films beginning . The balance of the film depicts that changes effect on the drug lord, his wife and children, the attorney, and - get this - the entire country of Mexico.Saldana is both beautiful and coldly efficient as the attorney. Selena Gomez as the drug lords wife gives what was, for me, her finest performance. Much of the film belongs to Karla Sofia Gascon who portrays both the drug lord as well as his feminine self Emilia Perez. Both selves are believable in every way imaginable .If there is any negative criticism I can offer it is that the films length seemed too much. Which is not say I was impatient. I was simply aware of moments that seemed a bit long or unnecessary.But I quibble.And shouldnt.See the film.",8,5,35,0.16706349206349208,0.5353174603174603

Im laughing as Im typing this realizing someone made this movie and seriously thought its worth watching. I have absolutely no clue how anyone can rate this garbage higher than 1.Its not just that the script is bad and that theres music that adds nothing to the movie. Its just outright bad, horrible story and actually nothing happening. As soon as you think something will happen its broken off with some lame song.

,"A Musical for Musical Haters: Raw, Subtle, Brechtian, and an Oscar Contender","As someone who normally avoids musicals, I was surprised by how much Emilia Perez captivated my attention. What sets this film apart is its seamless integration of music into the narrative. Unlike many musicals where characters unnaturally break into song-often to cringe-worthy effect-here the songs emerge organically, serving as reflections of the characters inner thoughts and emotions. Nothing feels forced or overdone, except perhaps the occasional TikTok-style dance sequences, which felt somewhat out of place.One of the most compelling elements of the movie is the subtlety of its musical execution. The songs are performed in a whisper-like tone, drawing the viewer in rather than overwhelming them with loud, theatrical vocals. This understated approach invites you to listen closely, creating an intimate connection with the characters. Similarly, the instrumental arrangements are restrained, blending seamlessly with ambient sounds and the natural environment. At times, the music feels like an extension of the world itself-a beautiful integration of street noises and atmospheric tones that enriches the storytelling.However, while the film excels in its musical and narrative aspects, it falters slightly in terms of its visual style. The lack of a consistent aesthetic or artistic color palette is noticeable. The naturalistic look of the film, reminiscent of a documentary, may have been a deliberate choice by the director to keep the focus on the story and characters rather than on visual spectacle. While this approach has its merits, it may leave some viewers longing for a more distinctive cinematic flair.The acting is another highlight, with performances that feel raw and authentic. The message of the film is delivered effectively, but it stops short of truly moving the audience to tears. This, too, seems intentional. By occasionally breaking the fourth wall and adopting a Brechtian style, the movie maintains a certain emotional detachment, encouraging the viewer to think critically rather than become fully absorbed in the drama.All in all, Emilia Perez is a unique and thoughtfully crafted film that challenges conventional musical tropes. While it may not tug at the heartstrings as much as some might expect, it delivers a refreshing and innovative cinematic experience. With its nuanced storytelling and strong performances, its no surprise that this film is being discussed as a contender for the 97th Academy Awards. Time will tell if it takes home the prize, but for now, its definitely worth a watch.",8,4,26,0.16664729501267966,0.4212841645533954
,The film initially seems to hold promise,"While Emilia Pérez had the potential to be an engaging film, it unfortunately misses the mark in several areas. The main character, Emilia, feels one-dimensional, with a backstory that is barely touched upon and motivations that are poorly explained. This lack of character depth makes it difficult for the audience to empathize with her journey.The cinematography, which had moments of promise, often feels inconsistent. Some scenes are beautifully shot, capturing the essence of the setting, while others appear rushed and lack the same level of detail. This inconsistency detracts from the overall visual experience of the film.The plot, which initially seems to hold promise, becomes increasingly convoluted as the story progresses. Subplots are introduced without adequate development, leading to confusion and a sense of disarray. Additionally, the films resolution feels unsatisfactory, leaving several loose ends and unanswered questions.Moreover, the dialogue often comes across as stilted and unnatural, making interactions between characters feel forced and unconvincing. Despite the films potential, these issues prevent it from delivering a cohesive and compelling narrative.In summary, Emilia Pérez struggles with character development, inconsistent cinematography, a convoluted plot, and unnatural dialogue, resulting in a film that ultimately fails to resonate with its audience.",2,23,2,-0.013186813186813192,0.41718559218559226

,Redemption of a drug dealer,"Beloved by the European and American continents, but which has angered all of Mexico, Emilia Perez has become one of the most scandalous cases when it comes to making a film related to a rather severe problem in a country like Mexico. It should not be surprising how Jaques has represented the country because it is a film that is based on the perspective that Europe has on Latin America. Something that coincides quite a bit with the perspective that the United States has on Mexico and that is why it is quite divisive. For the eyes of the United States and Europe, this is a very good film because it fits with their perspective on Mexico. For the inhabitants of Mexico, on the other hand, there is no doubt that this was the worst way to portray the country for several reasons.First of all, the film is not badly directed and has a stable visual quality. It maintains the dark and exotic vision that Mexico has in other films. Even with a simple script that tries to emulate a soap opera, it can be processed without a problem. What has taken the Latin American public out of context was the participation of people with different accents. Both the dialogues and the lyrics of some songs have very strange phrases and the use of various accents makes the experience even stranger. For someone who is not familiar with the Mexican dialect, you can let it pass, although there are some spelling mistakes in the dialogues. Selena Gomezs dialogues are what caused the most scandal and it must be admitted that her accent makes her dialogues strange and hilarious. The character she plays was rewritten as a Mexican-American and it seems that this was done to not give Selena enough time to practice her pronunciation better. In general, it is not always necessary to be of such nationality to play a foreign character because there are cases like Bedazzled in which Brendan Fraser was able to say his dialogues in Spanish quite fluently. But in the case of Emilia Perez, it would have been more convenient to involve more people from Mexico or people who were able to replicate the accent much better.What generates different points of view in the film is the story of Emilia Perez and her transition. At first we meet him as a drug dealer who has committed atrocities, but wants to leave that life to be reborn as a woman. During his new stage, we see that he wants to do good by helping the wives of the disappeared. It is a story of redemption that is good in itself and coincides with the idea that anyone who has committed a terrible act can have a second chance. The only thing that the film does not fully explain is the reason why Manitas wants to leave the world of drug trafficking. Something must have happened for him to realize that his actions were wrong and to motivate him to leave his old life to start over. Manitas does not give an explanation of what made him want to change his life beyond his desire to be a woman. Manitas transition could be interpreted as a metaphor for the transformation from a despicable being to a purified being because Manitas, now as Emilia Pérez, has become someone willing to do good in the community. You can see that he wants to purge his sins, although it is not known how his profile as a person improved over the four years he was missing. As a story of redemption it is quite good even though more details could have been given. But what is shocking for the Latin American audience is the way it involves the real problems that Mexico and other Latin American countries suffer. There is also mention of government corruption in a musical number, but without going into much detail. It is known that the cartel has been involved in cases of disappearances and drug trafficking has been the main cause of Mexico suffering a high rate of violence. That the film presents us with a drug trafficker who has caused tragedies, suddenly changing and helping the people he has harmed to the point of becoming a saint, is not surprising that Mexicans have taken that as blasphemy. The anger in that regard is understandable, but Mexico is a world apart from the United States and Europe. Furthermore, the war on drugs was one of the reasons that Latin America gained a certain reputation in the eyes of the rest of the world. For this reason, foreign productions are going to represent Mexico and other Latin countries as places of drug trafficking due to the bad reputation that they have gained because of the cartel. What the film does is present the problem as something that seems to be solved overnight and that makes the film seem like a Disney-style fantasy.It seems that what Jacques wanted to do was to use a formula similar to Disney movies by including musical numbers composed by Camille. The music is quite good and the sequences are not bad, although the musical numbers are short. The film would not exactly qualify as a musical because the music and singing do not have much relevance in the film like any musical. As with Disney films, the musical numbers do not overshadow the entire film. Emilia Perez is more of a dramatic thriller at 85% and some songs seemed to want to apply a humorous touch. You could say that this is a low-level musical.To conclude, the film has good potential and if things like the cast and dialogue had been corrected, the conflicts in Mexico had been left aside and a little more development had been added to the title character, it would be a pretty good film. We should not expect Europe or the United States to make a very faithful representation of Mexico because it does not coincide with their vision. It will always be according to the perspective that they have on Mexico and that is something that must be taken into account. The movie is enjoyable from their perspective or for having something hilarious, but it is not recommended for the Mexican audience. Especially knowing the way it deals with the problems that Mexico still faces. The ideal would be to see it as a typical Hollywood-style fiction film. Of course it did not deserve so many nominations, but it is not the garbage that so many Mexicans are criticizing. It is just a superficial film made by someone with a perspective on Mexico that is no different than the rest of the world. My final rating for this movie is 8/10.",8,4,26,0.1134893334893335,0.44622928122928135

,"Creative, quirky, deep, and not perfect.","To start, Gascon and Saldana did an INCREDIBLE job. Gascons character was not an easy one to portray and she managed to beautifully capture and present her character with emotional depth, complexity, and palpable relatability.Although the film might have felt more authentic with a fluent Spanish-speaking character for Jessi , Selena gave a strong and refreshing performance of a unique and also complex character. Id love to see Selena branch out into more Latina and Spanish-speaking character roles if she can master a real Spanish accent.The musical elements were unexpected for such a storyline, but they ultimately helped present what are very heavy and sensitive topics in a lighter and more digestible way than your typical dramatic narco-violence film.As a Latina , I was moved by the creativity and open representation of a transgender character and their internal struggle before and after transition in a Latin-American society. These are still taboo topics and the trans community in Latin America is still marginalized and at-risk of violence. I value contemporary and inclusive representation of Latine society. More importantly, after watching interviews with the actors and production team, it was clear that the actors and screenwriters were passionate and proud about their film, storyline, and its cultural importance. As a creative endeavor, that is more important than anyones external review.I appreciated the mix-and-matching of creative elements to tell equally convoluted and complex personal odysseys of the three main characters. IMO, music and song best captured the deep emotions felt in a way that narrative script or a show of tears would not have been able to.It was not a perfect film, of course, and would have benefitted from a stronger Spanish script, Spanish lessons Selena and Saldana, and a deeper exploration of the three characters backgrounds, dreams, and motivations for the choices they each made.In sum, I appreciate the films artistic uniqueness, creative and bold storyline, and the intersectionality of deeply human themes of identity, gender, forgiveness, love, loyalty, friendship, parenthood, power and class dynamics and the unfortunate reality of cartel violence in Mexico.It did not run too long, in my opinion, and held my interest throughout.",8,3,17,0.19529239766081866,0.5542397660818714
,Dont waste money on this,"The main problem with this film is that it lacks the reality with which they want to focus the film, in addition to lacking good performances, the directors ideology in making a film with real problems was to make a satire mocking the reality of a country, The actors lack that spirit of the characters and in addition their performances are limited, Emilia Perez does not have a good story, it does not contain the passion by which the viewer can be attracted to see it, Hollywood has a real problem when treating inclusion in a forced way and also mocking stereotypes and stories, making them a mockery of the reality of what we live in these times.",1,17,1,0.21645021645021645,0.37202380952380953
,Leads Razzie nominations !!,"In overall, the film is perceived as extremely low-budget. It is a film with really terrible cinematography; it is worth noting that it wasnt filmed in Mexico. The plot would have been highly engaging, but the librettist provided very little substance. The dialogues appear to be written by an artificial intelligence with severe grammatical errors. The director used illogical dialogues that tailored to Mexican idioms. He only managed to depict the Mexican stigma in a bizarre or thoughtless manner. The dialogues and songs are illogical and nonsensical. The acting and vocal performances are very disappointing. The musicalization is bad and does not fit the storys context. The film isnt worth viewing because the plot is unrealistic and shallow.",1,17,1,-0.17122685185185185,0.5348148148148147
,Unwatchable,"Jacques Audiard is one of my favorite film makers. I never turn off a movie once I start. Emelia Perez was an exception.For the first 30 minutes things felt off. As I am not a native Spanish speaker or a fan of musicals, I assumed the feeling came from my lack of understanding, both of the culture and theatrical presentation.However, when the film switched to English and really started into the Trans plot line, I immediately got a crash course in how problematic this film is. It feels like the whole thing was written in a day and rushed in all regards. And I dont mean like a veteran band goes into the studio and jams out for a week. I mean like a bunch of amateurs who have never sang or danced or been to mexico throw something together last minute.I feel like mess is an overused descriptor online but with EP thats what it is. An embarrassing mess at that. You can just tell its insulting to some groups, and if you read the reviews that suspicion is crystalized.",2,17,1,-0.058928571428571434,0.33749999999999997
,Unexpectedly Good Film,"Emilia Pérez, a 2024 French-Mexican musical crime comedy, was one of the biggest surprises of the year for me. The film doesnt simply rely on genre tropes; instead, it cleverly intertwines a lawyers financial struggles, a transgender persons psychological journey, and societal crime issues into a captivating narrative. Its not just entertainment; its an artistic exploration of social themes.The economic pressures faced by lawyer Rita Moro Castro are crucial to the plots progression. Her need to survive forces her to make morally questionable choices, prompting viewers to reflect on the boundaries between law and ethics. The transgender experience of drug lord Juan Manitas Del Monte delves deeper into the complex issues of gender identity and societal prejudice. Karla Sofía Gascóns portrayal of Emilia is stunning; her exceptional acting perfectly captures the characters internal struggles and transformation. I wont spoil it, but her performance is a major highlight of the film.Beyond the compelling plot, Emilia Pérez is also an excellent musical. The musical numbers arent just for entertainment; they advance the plot, express character emotions, and enhance the films artistic merit. Overall, the actors deliver outstanding performances. The two lead actresses, Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofía Gascón, are particularly noteworthy, their nuanced portrayals showcasing the characters complexity and multifaceted nature. The dedication and high standards of the entire behind-the-scenes team are evident.In conclusion, Emilia Pérez is a highly recommended film. It boasts a captivating plot, superb acting, and beautiful musical numbers, but more importantly, it touches upon significant social issues that leave a lasting impression and encourage reflection.",8,3,17,0.22925213675213676,0.5233882783882784
,Disrespectful,"The whole movie is a huge lack of respect to the real victims of drug trafficking.The acting is terrible, the representation of Mexican culture is totally wrong, none of the actors are Mexican and they dont even make an effort to sound like Mexican.Not to mention the writers misinformation, who himself admitted in an interview that he had not even taken the time to learn how drug trafficking works in Mexico and how it has affected him over time. Musically its poor, the lyrics of the songs genuinely dont work.Overall it feels like a movie that was made by a person with a lot of money who wanted to make some production based in Mexico just to play on its stereotypes.",1,22,2,-0.024999999999999994,0.4166666666666667
,As beautiful as the first time I saw it.,"Emilia Perez is a movie about identity, love and the loss of who we care, who we love, who we want to be with.I felt really emotive about the characters and their relationships. I loved every song, and I understand why this movie has been nominated in the Oscars. It deserves its nominations because the movie is really beautiful, and the editing is very interesting. I care a lot about the soundtrack because I found it really powerful entertaining I think this movie will have its impact in a lot of peoples minds. I hope though. Because theres a lot of points in this movie that are powerful, especially in the speech that it wants to tell to the watcher.I also want to emphasize something. Indeed, the movie takes place in Mexico and the political context is really interesting and the movie mention it with some interesting point of view. I find it really interesting and really brightful from the director.I enjoyed it like more than the first time, definitely. I found the subject very interesting regarding the way it was make and how it is structured especially.It has definitely its place at the Oscars, and I really hope it will win some price.",8,5,37,0.3653333333333333,0.5426666666666666
,What a dumpster fire,"Emilia Pérez is a mess of a movie that tries to be deep but ends up being tone-deaf and painfully out of touch. Jacques Audiard takes on Mexican culture, crime, and trans identity with all the finesse of a sledgehammer, delivering a film that feels more like a collection of bad stereotypes than a meaningful story.First off, the setting and characters dont feel Mexican at all. Its obvious that no real effort was made to get the culture right-everything feels like a shallow, outsiders version of Mexico, complete with cliché aesthetics and a total lack of authenticity. Even Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto pointed out how fake it all looks, and hes right. The movie completely misses the mark on representing the countrys reality.Then theres the acting, which is just awful. Selena Gomez is completely out of place. Her Spanish sounds forced, her performance lacks depth, and she never quite fits into the films world. Eugenio Derbez even called her performance indefensible . The rest of the cast isnt much better, with over-the-top, soap opera-level acting that makes it impossible to take anything seriously.The movie also fumbles major social issues, treating cartel violence, corruption, and trans identity as gimmicks rather than real-life struggles. The idea of a drug lord finding redemption through gender transition is not just ridiculous but also borderline offensive. It reduces trans identity to a plot twist instead of treating it with the respect and depth it deserves. Instead of humanizing trans people, it plays into harmful stereotypes that dont help anyone.At its core, Emilia Pérez is a failed experiment-pretentious, poorly executed, and completely disconnected from the cultures and communities its trying to portray. Its the kind of movie that thinks its making a statement but ends up just frustrating everyone. A total waste of time.",2,22,2,-0.10883204633204634,0.4714607464607465
,A trans experience at the back of a humanitarian crisis,"I so wanted to like this movie. I had such high hopes but Im sorry Im so mad at this. I kept watching and it wasnt until the next day that it hit me why something that has everything I love was so despicable to me: This movie has no soul. Its like that art project you do at film school where you pick the most shocking theme to get a rise but understand nothing about the subject. The drug wars in Mexico are a humanitarian crisis, there has been thousands of deaths and its something that every Mexican lives and is hurt by. To have a movie use it as an excuse for the journey or redemption of a character that never really feels guilty and doesnt actually achieve redemption whatsoever? Deeply. Insulting. Im not even gonna get into the Spanish used. Might as well use google translate to make a movie but whatever its the least of the movies issues.",2,22,2,-0.18127450980392157,0.4837254901960784
,A Shallow Misstep That Feels Uncomfortably Disjointed,"Karla Sofía Gascón was the only thing that kept me from walking out before the halfway mark. The film is so caricatured and shallow that it becomes uncomfortable to watch.Perhaps the language barrier, which often hampers international films, worked in this ones favor. The performances are weak and overly exaggerated, with poorly delivered dialogues and scenes. The musical pieces feel disconnected and out of place, adding to the overall disjointedness of the movie.Moments that should carry weight instead feel awkward and forced, making it hard to stay engaged. Not to mention, Selenas performance: painfully unconvincing and embarrassing, noticeable to anyone with even the slightest familiarity with Spanish.Emilia Pérez sadly comes across as a B-movie in style and execution, attracting attention it does not merit.",1,22,2,-0.32142857142857145,0.5976190476190476
,Worth It,"The way i randomly decided to watch it but gosh! It was beyond my expectations. Karla Sofía Gascón as Manitas, Selena Gomez as Jessi, Zoe Saldana as Rita Mora Castro, Adriana Paz as Epifania and Édgar Ramírez as Gustavo Brun they were all incredible.And SELENA? I knew she is a talented actress but didnt knew she is this good. From the beginning to the end, I watched the whole movie without a skip. Shes one of the reasons why.I hope she continues to serve like this in the acting industry.And thanks to whoever recommended me this movie. I enjoyed and loved it a lot. Best Wishes for the whole team.",10,6,48,0.35750000000000004,0.48
,Emilia Pérez: The Risk of Telling Stories You Don't Understand,"I didnt want to write this review, but I felt I had to. As a Mexican and a film student, I cant stay silent about Emilia Pérez. This movie isnt just poorly written - it feels like an episode ripped straight from a badly made narco soap opera. The melodrama is so clumsy it borders on the absurd.It feels as if the director skimmed through one or two articles about drug trafficking in Mexico and thought that made him an expert. The result is a shallow story that neither understands nor respects the gravity of the subject. And when the topic involves the desaparecidos - one of Mexicos deepest wounds - that ignorance isnt just noticeable, its offensive. In its lack of understanding, Id go as far as to say the script even veers into racist territory.Is there anything redeemable? Maybe the cinematography. But even the songs dont work - they arent songs, theyre just rhythmic dialogue. Ive seen a lot of criticism regarding the casting, and while I dont entirely disagree, I believe thats the least of the films problems.To the festivals that awarded Emilia Pérez, I extend an invitation: watch Im No Longer Here or El Infierno. Both are powerful examples of what can be achieved with proper research, sensitivity, and a genuine understanding of Mexicos social issues. In comparison, Emilia Pérez is exposed for what it truly is - a mix of pretension and ignorance.The one redeeming element, in my opinion, is Karla Sofías performance. She delivers a worthy effort in a film that otherwise falls short of the story it claims to tell.",3,30,4,-0.033333333333333305,0.45745614035087717
,Powerful stuff.,"Just watched it; having quickly turned on my translational subtitles.The eternal question; if you had all the money in the world what do you want?. Well this is different, but not that much.All actors play their part to the limit. No problem.The musical interludes provide a musical staccato to the storyline, and the effectiveness builds.There are philosophical questions asked, and as it progresses some are answered, some not. Circumstances are carefully developed to deny that.A good film is where the storyline rings bells in your head, and has enough twists and turns to command your attention throughout. Emilia Perez does it in spades.Powerful stuff.",8,4,27,0.14166666666666666,0.3125
,Hard to avoid expletives watching this production,"To be honest, I heard about this movie reading a news article that it won some kind of awards. Looking into this a bit more, it won some big awards and the last one being the golden globe.Out of curiosity I started to watch it given the fact that such unanimity in nominating, according to an online encyclopaedia, a movie for more than a hundred awards in more than 50 festivals means either the movie is either the pinnacle of its domain or, no spoilers here, its filling the needs of the industry in some socio-political aspects.Thankfully the movie is available on a streaming platform for which I have a subscription, so I saved some time and money there, and it took about 5 minutes to discover why I wouldnt spend more than that and rather washed dirty dishes then ironed the family laundry.The plot of the movie is... the current day in Mexico. So, take current day tropes, all of them, and mash them into this production. I did skip here and there and was rewarded systematically with the same current-dayism.No wonder the industry liked it, its the epitome of navel gazing and some would probably say propaganda. You may like it but I surely couldnt stomach it any more than what I experienced. I wish I could have given a zero.",1,64,13,0.27999999999999997,0.5140277777777779
,A tonal mess,"After all the Oscar nominations, I ignored multiple friends who had seen it and hated it and sat down to decide to have an opinion myself. It gets marks for bravery, but I dont know what this film wants to be.Its very hard to take seriously when everybody burst into song and choreographed dance. It isnt entertaining enough to be a great musical . I get that for a lot of people in Mexico the fact that this is directed by Frenchman and none of the main actors are Mexican makes this feel fake to them. It feels fake to me and I live in England!The songs arent catchy , this feels like this years Saltburn or Cats. Who is this for? For the average person on the streets there are too many ideas here to make it coherent. Its tonally all over the place which again is a huge problem. Everybody involved is patting themselves on the backs being very pleased with themselves forgetting that the film itself fails in every category its trying in.If this wins a bunch of Oscars, itll be a bit like Crash. A sign of the disconnect between what Hollywood thinks people want and what people actually consider either good or entertaining.The cinematic equivalent of the Emperors new clothes.",2,21,2,0.060436091686091695,0.48452311577311574
,What is the point of this movie?,"Okay, lets accept the ridiculous premise. Is the point acceptance or is it exploitive of the novelty its putting forward? The acting is not good simply because of ones immutable characteristics and yet this is the only central piece of the story. And on top of it all, its a musical. A not very good musical with no memorable songs or melodies. The actors say exactly what theyre feeling in their songs and there is little to no subtlety.I get it, its a giant metaphor for the trans experience and the longing to change for sake of harmony. What it ignores is the body is only the reflection of the mind. And if the mind is broken, the body cannot make one whole.",2,25,3,-0.018892450142450133,0.5121489621489622
,Engaging and troubling,"This movie is unique. It tells the tale of changing from a man to a woman in a very original setting. The transformation is more than a gender change: it is a transformation of character. The man is a criminal who has engaged in horrible crimes. His belief is that he was forced into this role by circumstances, but that he has always wanted to be a woman, which would afford him freedom to be the real self buried inside him. The huge life alteration this change implies makes the transformation far more dramatic than otherwise.What adds to the contrast between the two lives is the presence of Zoë Saldaña who looms over the proceedings like an extraterrestrial, underlining what is going on and adding huge depth to how we feel about what we see.You will be transfixed by this movie and forced to wonder what lessons it teaches us.",8,4,27,0.04070512820512821,0.6634615384615384

This alone would be deplorable, but is not just that, it didnt worked. Everyone sings so bad, looks like a very bad sketch from the worse season from SNL.Everything looks like a terrible joke, disrespectful with Mexicans, with trans people and, above all, with the art of cinema in general.

,I dig this,"I was genuinely surprised by how this worked. Its easy to doubt it, yet the director and actresses managed to pull it off seamlessly. My favorite musical number was El Mal, but I also really loved Mi Camino. I just wish they had included it fully within the movie itself instead of saving it for the credits. The surgery room number was bizarre yet hilarious. It felt very camp and fresh..Gomez did an incredible job portraying the anger and frustration of a single mom caught up as a pawn in a larger scheme.Saldana deserves her flowers. She brilliantly captured the desperation of an undervalued lawyer making rash decisions and then having to face the fallout of those choices.Gascon was literally the bridge that connects everything, perfectly embodying the idea that no matter how much a person might change, their past is unchangeable.Theres a lot happening very quickly. After my first watch, my honest reaction was Well, thats interesting. It wasnt until my second watch that I truly absorbed everything. Overall, I genuinely enjoyed the movie. Its camp, weird, and refreshingly original.",10,7,61,0.27962454212454213,0.5934981684981685
,"Just a bad movie, not worth the hype","I was excited about the 13 nominations and decided to watch the film.From a cinematic point of view, it is an average film. The photography is correct, the rhythm works most of the time and the script is shallow, but ok. The acting is below average and not even the main actress can save it. Now the worst for me are the songs and musical scenes... the songs are bad, not memorable and take you out of the films immersion. They are laughable to sum up.The whole plot of the film about a big drug trafficker who redeems himself and has a rebirth with a woman , in which he is forgiven of his sins, seemed cheap to me and something I expected to hear from a sensationalist neo-Pentecostal church.I didnt mind Selena Gomezs Spanish and I also think that a director can make a film in a language he doesnt speak in a country he doesnt know deeply. But you have to have common sense and respect. The complete disconnection of a white European man with Latin cultures, the trans community and the romanticization of a war on drugs seems unforgivable to me. I give it 3 stars for the aesthetic effort and originality.In the end, I think the Oscar nominations show how they still have a total lack of knowledge and empathy for marginalized groups. Even when they have good intentions. But as they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.",2,25,3,0.005864197530864201,0.44814814814814813
,Awful,"Its like a real bad parody, like... Trying to be funny but failing at it over and over. The music is not creative, like it was written using AI, the acting is just lazy. Worst part is director being all arrogant thinking there was actually no need to investigate mexican culture, in order to make a movie about mexican culture. I found it to be just offensive.I understand the need of Sofia to proclaim herself the best actress in the whole world, but then she cant be offended when she learns that shes not good at all. Not good at acting, at dancing or at singing. And the same goes to Selena and Zoey .If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, dont take it!",1,20,2,-0.11666666666666667,0.475
,It's not worth it,"It is rude to say that this is Mexico. Is just the misconception of a man mired in ignorance and lack of empathy and research, on a much more serious problem than he portrays.And the discontent is not with Selenas accent, or the completely weird accent of Zoe Saldañas Mexican accent when the only thing Mexican here were the expressions that were not at all stereotypical. Joke.Not to mention the songs, my God. Who wrote that? The kid? Like why did Emilia or Manitas smell like Guacamole, Coke with lemon and ice, cigarette, lamb??? I mean, you can smell like all that, Ill forgive you if Manitas went to the market every day for a walk, but a little bath so the kid doesnt say you smell like a street food stand during rush hour.This film could have been incredible if the director had done what a person who is going to talk about a country, a topic, a problem as serious as forced disappearances would do. But karma or whatever you want to call it is coming little by little. Learning from this abomination: do your research, do not belittle the talent of the country you are talking about and Use your power to speak out and change a reality, not make it your filler for some weird victim-perpetrator romance.",1,20,2,-0.16127450980392158,0.6306372549019608

Im not familiar with the directors work and not being Mexican, I cant speak to the vernacular, but I thought it was wonderfully creative. Enjoyed it throughout.

,one of the worst movies i've ever seen,"Emilia Pérez is an unmitigated disaster that fails on every conceivable level. The films attempt to blend a crime drama with a musical is not only misguided but painfully executed, resulting in a jarring tonal mess that leaves audiences cringing rather than entertained.The portrayal of Mexican culture is nothing short of offensive, relying on tired stereotypes that reduce a rich and diverse heritage to a series of clichés. The decision to cast non-Mexican actors in key roles, coupled with the atrocious Spanish accents, only adds insult to injury.

,Bold and Very Risky,"IMO hands down, one of the best movies of the year. The movie tells such an original story about how drug cartels and corruption have just wrecked Mexican society and innocent lives. Gascon perfectly portrayed both the cartel leader and a woman trying to *fix* her past mistakes.Anddd, I love Zoe Saldana. Been a fan since From Scratch and Lioness, so when I heard she was starring alongside Selena Gomez, I was already hyped. They didnt disappoint at all.But real talk, the Spanish with English subtitles was kinda tricky for me. The movie moves so fast, and I was struggling to read the captions and actually watch the action. Its like, by the time I finished reading, boom, next line. Had to keep rewinding to catch everything.

,A hymn to Eurocentrism,"I dont even know where to start.Im not in the position to point out all the issues with the trans representation, but as a mexican woman I can speak about other issues:The script is poorly written. From the songs to the dialogue it uses phrases and words that make it obvious the writers were not familiar enough with the language. Some grammar mistakes are toddler level and the accents make it feel like none of these characters have lived in Mexico for even a year, resulting in dialogue that feels too forced and fake.The characters are lacking soul and their journeys are just not believable. Id like to say that Saldañas character is at least a bit savable, but Rita is just so boring. Trying to represent a strong and intelligent woman who criticises the system, but does nothing to actually stand up for her supposed beliefs.The portrayal of Mexico feels like nothing but a racist and insensitive caricature. From the sets to the actual plot. You have people being attacked at a Tianguis while also having Rita working with her laptop there. You have the characters living in Mexico City but somehow the final scenes tale place in a desert-like area?Audiard takes a very serious, very painful problem, and doesnt bother to touch it with the respect it deserves. Having narcos and politics having a change of heart and helping the searching parties when in reality those are the people that shut them up is incredibly disrespectful to their fight. Having a searching mother kissing Emilias hand and then turning her into a saint is a grotesque show of ignorance and unwillingness to learn about this issue in depth.Cruel art should not be celebrated.

It has everything to please the viewer: humor, drama, musical scenes and just when we think its over, it offers us 20 minutes of climax at the end, with a plot twist that takes us by surprise! As for the cast, Karla Sofía Gascón emerges as a future screen diva. What a magnificent performance! I hope she is recognized by the Academy with an Oscar. Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez complete the female trio with formidable performances, especially in the dance scenes with iconics choreographies. Emília Pérez is already emerging as a new classic movie of contemporary cinema. 10 out of 10!",10,10,100,0.278030303030303,0.44829545454545455
,Audiart is a chauvinistic moron,"This film is the perfect example of what happens when a director is too arrogant to do even the bare minimum of research. Instead of offering a thoughtful or nuanced portrayal of a country, Audiard delivers a lazy, ignorant, and insultingly shallow caricature, driven entirely by his own inflated sense of superiority. The result? A film so full of forced, outdated stereotypes that it feels like satire-except the only real stereotype here is Audiard himself, embodying the worst kind of smug, self-satisfied French arrogance.And then theres the music. If you thought the writing was bad, wait until you hear the lyrics-so atrocious that even a random street musician does better blindfolded. The entire film reeks of pretension, as if Audiard genuinely believes hes too brilliant to need accuracy, depth, or even basic respect for Mexico.Do Parisians actually think their farts smell like flowers? I refuse to believe it, but if anyone were to make the case for it, its this moron director.Emilia is not just a bad film-its an embarrassing display of ignorance, arrogance, and sheer laziness masquerading as artistic vision. I feel sorry for Zoe and Selena who got ripped off by this mess.",1,23,3,-0.03416666666666666,0.6305555555555556
,"Scattered, overfull, and poorly wrought generally - with specific, appalling issues that hound it","I didnt have high expectations in the first place. While Id previously seen the name in passing I knew nothing otherwise of the picture, and my first meaningful knowledge came after the 2025 Oscar nominations, with an article title that described Emilia Pérez as both the most-nominated feature at the Academy Awards and the worst film of the year. From there one reads of the harsh criticism this has received from people who are in an apt position to judge it - for its use of the Spanish language, for its depiction of Mexico, and certainly not least for how it treats trans people. Be all that as it may, there comes a point where reading about a movie, good or especially bad, isnt enough, and we have to see it for ourselves. And so I have. And, friends, I rather think its even worse than I had imagined. Within even the first couple scenes this makes a horrible impression, and I dont know how in the world this muck ever got approved for production unless it was as a deliberate jab at the communities that have rightly taken offense. Its not perfectly rotten, and there are some facets to appreciate, but as far as Im concerned its a regrettable mess with too little lasting worth to deserve anything except the sort of passing praise that is given to politely balance out more proliferate negative remarks.There are earnest notions herein that, handled with appropriate care, could have been ripe for compelling drama and impactful storytelling to resonate with audiences from all corners and cultures. There is the person, in this case a high-profile criminal, who has lived a life of violence and wishes to leave it behind, with some reckoning of conscience to invariably come. There is the person, in this case a trans individual, who wishes to live life authentically, coming from a time and place where they feel they cannot, and who recognizes that to do so must mean cutting much out of their life and hitting the proverbial reset button. There are the other people surrounding this central figure who are drawn into the drama one way or another, having their lives changed, too, with their own parts to play, not least as our central figure finds it difficult to entirely leave their past behind. There is the reflection on the terrible history of cartel violence in Mexico, fueled by drug prohibition around the world and especially in the United States, which has destroyed countless innocent lives. There was indeed fine potential in the underlying ideas, to say nothing of the promise of swell modern production values, and surely splendid aesthetic considerations. Given the musical inclinations, we will of course also hope for flavorful music and enticing choreography.Unfortunately, all such hopes are at best only partly and lightly satisfied. The flick inspires criticism pretty much as soon as it begins, in too many ways to concisely expound upon, and what value it can claim is all too little and inconsequential in comparison. Im given to understand that French filmmaker Jacques Audiard has admitted to not particularly researching the country and culture of Mexico in which the tale is predominantly set, and that alone is a grievous foible that should have hamstrung Emilia Pérez the moment he expressed that truth. As if that werent enough, his direction tends to come off as forceful and false, at too many points impacting the acting even from respected stars, and similarly informing Paul Guilhaumes cinematography in turn; plenty of shots and scenes present quite well, but too many are painfully gauche and unconvincing. Then there are the apparent comments by casting director Carla Hool that they found talent in Mexico to be lacking, comments that are shameful and preposterous as the long and celebrated history of Mexican cinema easily proves Hool wrong. Obliquely emphasizing the point: even putting aside their nationality, or how Audiards direction impacts them, or according disparagement of their diction in Spanish, I cant help but feel at many times that Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez were miscast; in my opinion they find only partial success in these roles and performances.Granted, more than not the cast is just fine, at least if they can get past the troubles of Audiards direction. Saldaña and Gomez both have moments where they shine; theres no question in my mind that Karla Sofía Gascón gives a good performance, and even those in smaller supporting roles, like Adriana Paz, are a minor joy. Yet for all the criticism Emilia Pérez deserves, the storytelling in this title - both the active narrative and its treatment of specific groups, cultures, or ideas - is the sorest spot of all. While I cant necessarily speak to others on hand I know to a certainty that Saldaña and Gomez arent hurting for work in their respective careers; did no one read Audiards script before signing on? Were the contracts for the actors participation predicated only on the broad thoughts underpinning it all?There actually is some commendable substance in these 130 minutes, but the sad truth is that the film is scattered, conflicted, confused, and quite at odds with itself. Audiard tries to do too much here in the first place, weaving together the spectacle of the musical, the seediness of the crime flick, and the tangled weave of personal drama; the complications of professional association with criminal elements, and the parallel stories of an individual both trying to reform themselves and live life as their true self; the dire, all too real tableau of cartel violence, and the destruction that falls on innocent lives, and attempts to heal, with some action-thriller ideations to go along with it in the back end; a trans story, and queer representation; and still more. Then theres the fact of how this French production treats Mexico, for even one who is not specifically familiar or well versed in the country or its culture can plainly recognize how Audiards representation seems to be built off of a lot of stereotypes and ill-informed, heavy-handed conceptions, with little to no nuance. Its no wonder that this was so poorly received in Mexico.And while there might have been honest intent in terms of telling a trans story, and in casting a trans actor in the titular role, its readily evident that neither Gascón nor any other trans folks had any input on the material written by cisgender Audiard and approved by cisgender studio executives. From the first scene when we meet Manitas, to dubious musical numbers La vaginaplastia and Lady, to the subsequent treatment of the title character, this feature - like the vast preponderance that would claim to tell a trans story - cares more about sensationalism, about the parts of being transgender that are most alien or off-putting to cisgender people, and about otherwise using trans identity as a set piece, than it does about sincerely and truthfully speaking to the reality that trans and gender non-conforming people live on a daily basis. Like the vast preponderance of features that would claim to tell a trans story, Emilia Pérez carelessly toys with the real and former lives of trans individuals, telling us that Manita is Pérez and Pérez is Manita when and only as it suits them. In so doing the screenplay depicts its one trans character as manipulative and duplicitous, as much because of their gender identity as because of their former life. In so doing, even with a trans actor in the chief role, Emilia Pérez becomes ignorantly, appallingly transphobic as it paints the trans community with notes of freakishness and deception.Some musical numbers are quite good, and some , are downright awful. Even the better examples suffer from insipid, poorly written lyrics , and the style of singing were commonly treated to raises a quizzical eyebrow. I do like the music and the choreography in general, though I believe even these tend to suffer from the forcefulness if not also the falseness of Audiards direction, and like forcefulness in Camilles songwriting and in the choreography. Perhaps other aspects like production design and art direction, stunts and effects, hair and makeup, costume design, and sound are commendable in and of themselves - but the ends to which they were guided may be another matter, and considering all the other issues that this faces, I have a hard time caring about the work turned in by those operating behind the scenes. Sorry, crew. Truly.I recall very well when Peter Farrellys Green book was released, and met with various accolades, how it was met with criticism of not treating the concept with meaning and authenticity; I saw it described, instead, as a movie about racial turmoil written in such a way that it could let white people feel good about themselves. Frankly, I think the same is true of this 2024 release, except as applied to Mexico, cartel violence, and above all the trans community, sugarcoating the experience in flavors that would appeal to non-Mexicans, those ignorant of social issues and geopolitics, and cisgender viewers and award ceremony voters. I did not enter with high expectations, and when all is said and done I believe the result is even worse than I could have conceived of. I maintain that Emilia Pérez isnt all bad, and there was potential here, but among others, Audiard really fouled it all up with his direction and most of all with his writing. Ive seen worse pictures, but glaringly few that were so high profile, or which received so many award nominations that they did not deserve. Whatever lasting worth this might boast is all too vanishingly little, and whatever it is youre hoping to get out of Emilia Pérez, I urgently suggest you look elsewhere. For its overall failures it should be cast aside; for its worst faults, particularly with regards to Mexico and the trans community, it should be panned, castigated, and all but condemned.",2,23,3,0.026241454356208452,0.4745238095238095
,"Wow, the disrespect","This movie, I tried to put aside everything I had heard regarding non Hispanic actors doing bad Spanish interpretation.Coming from Monterrey , I can only say this movie is a disgrace to everyone who can ever say they have done a simple visit to Mexico, you dont even have to be here for longer than 2 days to understand that subjects like disappearances are not a joke. Like I said, I tried to put aside all cliche and previous bad comments, but it is impossible to not feel disappointed, disrespected, and at some point, you feel the movie has gone way too far, you can only laugh about the poor script.I cannot believe people imagine this movie is a reality.How did Selena didnt even notice her husband just became a woman? And also, he was a narco and then became a savior of disappeared Mexicans? They dressed Emilia Perez as the virgin of Guadalupe, a holy figure in Mexico.

,A must Watch !,"Art is commonly defined as skill, the ability of people to do something expressive, beautiful, and aesthetic. It is therefore a human activity, the product of this activity, or the idea which is made of it, deliberately addressing the senses, the emotions, the intuitions and the intellect.As the film maker Henri Langlois said, cinema is an art and art implies artifice. The spectators of cinema are thus immersed in a sensory and dynamic universe where sounds, shapes, materials, vibrant colors and phantasmagoric images evoke real life and create an atmosphere both mysterious and captivating.However, how can cinema - which is considered somehow as a high art become a means of denunciation?Artwork is not strong enough to be against political power, used to say, Shakespeare. However, Cinema can nevertheless be a real means of questioning political forces. Certainly, true artwork liberates the minds of the audience, the public, the society in a word. Its main function is to raise awareness among the public.In this political satire film, Emilia Perez, Jacques Audiard denounces the passive battle of the Mexican Government against their countless crime problems.He ridicules the authoritarian personality and the megalomania of a Cartel Lord and denounces both the anti-system and the brutality of the Mexican way of life, through parody.Its been fully criticized by Mexicans because it is not 100% accurate to what reality truly is.I disagree. Art is the expression of thoughts that seek to understand the world and to make it understood by the public. Thus, the filmmakers, who are indeed considered as artists, are not limited to reality. They add to their works a part of interpretation, they complete their own vision and interpretations of social reality.In my opinion it is a great movie.

,A dystopian caricature of a movie,"If you love musicals/operas, you will hate this movie - the lyrics are as flat as the actors trying miserably to hit the notes.If you love an interesting main character, you will hate this movie - the writers tried to make a hero out of a drug trafficer who shows no sign of remorse and leaves his wife and children to go play dress up as a woman.If you love Mexican culture, you will hate this movie - it is hard to watch how it is caricatured here.If you are a Catholic, you will hate this movie - the trans drug trafficking main character who, as I wrote before, shows zero signs of repentance, appears as a mock statue of the Virgin Mother while women sing his praise. Really? Im not a Catholic but that is just revolting.All in all, just do yourselves a favor and put on My Fair Lady or The Sound of Music or Funny Face or some kind of musical where there is an actual female hero who does interesting things, has some character development and where people have talent, can sing and the respective cultures are actually appreciated.Those are movies that are timeless, while pieces like Emilia Perez, which, sure, are praised right now, are going to become like the socialist propaganda movies the USSR produced, where it is just cringeworthy to watch them now.

,"Passionate, odd, but truly compelling","This is an extraordinary film that bears sticking with. Initially it comes over as a clever take on transgender drama, almost something Pedro Almadovar might have come up with, including musical interludes, but it transforms into a wider drama about identity, personal journeys, and the deep scars left on Mexican society by violent drug cartels. Its clever, imaginative, often quite gripping, and impressively fresh in its approach, though you might also call it a little barmy too, and I can quite understand that to some its storyline and treatment might offend. The music, whilst it fits into the plot, I found mostly not that striking , but there are some tremendous performances, and overall, a sense you are seeing something very contemporary , passionate, and ultimately very compelling.",8,4,28,0.10567460317460316,0.5434920634920635

,What the what,"I almost never write reviews on IMDb, but for this I will make an exception. I will preface my review with, before even pressing play, I wanted to like this film. I didnt go into the movie wanting to write any sort of critique. With so many nominations, I had high hopes that I would be blown away. But I was so incredibly disappointed instead. There was just so much lacking on multiple fronts. I dont understand why some people are raving about it.The acting was okay, so I wont fault the film for that , but I just could not get past everything else.I agree with other reviewers that they bit off more than they could chew with this film. There was so much going on all at once that not one plot point was ever deep enough to make it make sense on an emotional level. There was no emotional depth to any of the characters, so I didnt feel anything towards any of them. They all fell flat in one way or another.The disconnect between a violent and deadly cartel boss and a kind do-gooder transgender woman are too great for it to make sense that this could possibly be the same person. Absolutely no one has personality changes like this in real life. Im usually all about the suspension of disbelief in movies, but this was too much. Like, yes absolutely, we as people are a mix of both good and bad things and it is possible to want to make changes halfway through your life. But in my opinion, this was a complete 180. Rich, murderous, secretive cartel boss to generous, mild-mannered, public-facing woman? In what world?Also, why did they even make this into a musical? It adds nothing. Neither the music nor lyrics were any good . The musical numbers did not flow well with the rest of the movie, and in fact, it felt so forceful at times, like someone decided to just throw in the musicality randomly after they created the rest of the movie just to elicit more attention to a genre-bending film.Plus, the ending was so far out of left field that i was left flabbergasted as the credits rolled.",3,9,0,0.07087500000000001,0.4720416666666667

,Outstanding movie that is a Must see,"Emilia Perez is a dazzling, genre-bending French film that defies expectations and delivers a poignant, entertaining, and visually stunning experience. Directed by Jacques Audiard, the movie is a triumphant blend of drama, humor, and musical elements, masterfully woven into a compelling narrative about identity, redemption, and transformation.The story follows Emilia Perez, a feared Mexican cartel boss who decides to undergo a radical change-both literal and metaphorical-by embracing her-his true self and seeking freedom from her violent past. Through this journey, the film deftly explores themes of gender, self-discovery, and the courage it takes to change ones life.One of the films greatest strengths is its lead performance. The casting of Karla Sofía Gascón as Emilia is nothing short of inspired. She brings depth, charisma, and authenticity to the role, portraying Emilias internal struggles and outward transformation with incredible nuance. Gascóns magnetic presence ensures that every scene feels both intimate and larger-than-life.The films musical sequences are another standout feature. With vibrant choreography and a richly layered soundtrack, these moments provide a theatrical, almost dreamlike quality that heightens the emotional stakes. The juxtaposition of the musical elements with the gritty, action-packed storyline is bold and fresh, offering an unforgettable viewing experience.The cinematography by Claire Mathon captures the contrasting worlds of violence and beauty with equal finesse. From the harsh, shadowy corridors of the cartel underworld to the vivid, sunlit expanses of Emilias new life, every frame feels meticulously crafted.Audiards direction ensures that the film never loses its emotional core, even amidst the chaos of its action and musical interludes. He masterfully balances the films tone, allowing its humor and lightness to coexist with its more serious and heartfelt moments.Overall, Emilia Perez is a cinematic triumph that offers something truly unique.

,Disaster,"Emelia Perez is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The story is incoherent, leaving viewers confused and frustrated. The acting is wooden, with the cast seemingly uninterested in their own roles. The dialogue is cringeworthy, making it painful to sit through every scene. The direction is amateurish, with sloppy editing that further ruins the pacing. The cinematography is dull and lifeless, making the entire film visually unappealing. The soundtrack does nothing to enhance the experience and feels misplaced. Every attempt at emotion or depth falls flat, leaving the film devoid of any redeeming value.

Its also really interesting how you can create a musical thats two hours long and have zero good songs. If one thing is for sure, this film is definitely an industry plant.

And the actresses deserve a separate chapter...

,A Great Story that Didn't Need to be a Musical,"Im a fan of musicals, especially when theyre done well, but there are times when the musical elements in a film feel disconnected from the story. Emilia Pérez is currently streaming on Netflix, and since its debut at several film festivals, it has garnered a lot of attention. While I think the story itself is fantastic, I feel the film suffers from its choice to be a musical. The film tackles a very serious and often intense subject matter, where characters can be in real danger, so when they suddenly break out into song, the tone shift can be jarring. Although I believe Emilia Pérez deserves to be seen for its strong narrative, I fear that the musical elements might pull some viewers out of the experience or cause them to lose interest.The plot centers around Rita Moro Castro , a struggling lawyer hired by a powerful drug cartel leader to assist with a dangerous and illegal procedure. The leader, who is unhappy in their own skin, wishes to transition into a woman, leading to a complex web of family drama and illegal activities. The story unfolds in a compelling way, with constant twists that keep the audience engaged throughout. Despite the intriguing narrative, the decision to make the film a musical didnt quite work for me. The songs, while catchy, often felt out of place given the intensity of the themes and the stakes at play.This story is one that certainly deserves to be told, and the performances from the entire cast are remarkable. Zoe Saldana delivers a gripping performance as the lead, and the supporting cast is equally strong. The cinematography is also top-notch, with visually stunning shots that complement the films dramatic atmosphere. Jacques Audiards direction and screenplay add depth to the characters and the plot, making the film more immersive. His work on films like You Were Never Really Here made me confident in the quality of the dialogue, and once again, he does not disappoint.Emilia Pérez is a well-crafted film with a strong story, great performances, and impressive technical execution. However, had it been told without the musical elements, I might have connected with it even more. While the musical numbers are enjoyable in their own right, they occasionally clash with the gravity of the narrative. Still, I would absolutely recommend this film to anyone interested in compelling stories, well-executed direction, and an engaging cast. Its a film that stands out in many ways, and despite my reservations about the musical aspect, its worth seeing.",8,3,20,0.1675757575757576,0.544978354978355
,"Of all Spanish-language films, this one is the worst.","Please, just a moment... What if the intended language was Spanish? The film was awful. As a result, this is what a disaster a can sound like. The music is in Spanish; that does not make any sense, and it was translated using Google Translate. That level of self-assurance is entirely inconsistent with your limited understanding of the topic. Although the subject matter is delicate in Mexico, the use of Spanish in the film makes it seem like a disrespect. I can understand how it could be an alternative narco film, but I really hope no one takes offense when a foreigner uses their language in such a way.",1,13,1,-0.08528138528138528,0.37283549783549785
,What the heck is this shlock?,"Emilia Pérez is a cinematic misstep that egregiously mishandles its subject matter, resulting in a film that is both offensive and insipid. Directed by Jacques Audiard, this so-called musical attempts to tell the story of a Mexican cartel leader who transitions genders to escape his past-a premise that is as ill-conceived as its execution.The films portrayal of Mexican culture is nothing short of a caricature, laden with stereotypes that reduce a rich and diverse heritage to a series of clichés. The narrative is riddled with superficial depictions of narco violence, offering no meaningful insight into the complexities of the issues at hand. Instead, it opts for sensationalism, trivializing the very real suffering associated with drug cartels.Moreover, Emilia Pérez fails spectacularly in its representation of the transgender experience. The protagonists transition is portrayed as a convenient plot device, devoid of authenticity or sensitivity. This not only undermines the struggles and triumphs of the transgender community but also perpetuates harmful misconceptions. GLAAD rightfully criticized the film for its profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman, highlighting its regressive stance on gender identity.The casting choices further exacerbate the films shortcomings. Selena Gomezs performance is particularly egregious; her Americanized Spanish and lackluster acting contribute to a portrayal that is both unconvincing and grating. Eugenio Derbez aptly described her performance as indefensible, a sentiment echoed by many viewers.Despite garnering numerous awards and nominations, including 13 Oscar nods, Emilia Pérez stands as a testament to Hollywoods misguided attempts at inclusivity. The films accolades are baffling, given its glaring deficiencies in storytelling, character development, and cultural representation. It is a stark reminder that recognition does not equate to quality or respectfulness.In conclusion, Emilia Pérez is a deeply flawed film that offends more than it entertains. Its superficial treatment of complex issues, combined with poor performances and a lack of cultural sensitivity, make it a regrettable addition to contemporary cinema. Audiences seeking meaningful representation and storytelling would do well to look elsewhere.",3,13,1,0.05116666666666667,0.40577777777777774
,The Kids Aren't Alright,"When - 2:15 PM Where - Netflix With Who - MyselfFirst Thoughts - Lets call a spade a spade; the only reason this movie was nominated for 13 freaking Oscars was because it is about a transgender woman.There, with that elephant out of the room, lets get to my actual review.Who the heck are we the audience supposed to be rooting for here? The wayward lawyer who complains endlessly about her directionless life, but who does nothing to change her circumstances?The transgender drug lord who uproots his familys lives not once, but twice and whose selfishness ultimately leads to his children becoming orphans? Including sending his family to Switzerland, faking his death, transitioning to a trans woman, and then demanding his children back and bringing his family away from their home in Switzerland nearly five years later. Only to throw a fit when the lie he has created in order to keep his children with him falls apart because his ex-wife and the mother of his children found love again and wants to marry, cutting her off financially and eventually leading to the death of himself, his childrens mother, and her fiancée.The ex-wife and mother who is more focused on partying with her lover and stumbling in the morning after than being a loving, caring mother to her children?Every character here is horrible, self-centered, and unlikable, I just feel sorry for the two fictional boys thrown in the middle of everything.Technically, this film is a disaster, the lighting is terrible and so inconsistent there are moments where you cant see whats happening onscreen. The cinematography is also extremely unsteady for seemingly no reason. This is also a musical, and every single song can barely be considered a song. Its more like fast, low talking with a beat behind it, and its more annoying than anything.Full Review to follow.",1,13,1,-0.020046082949308743,0.5359447004608294
,There is so much here to be admired,"Im not at all familiar with the works of Jacques Audiard, but there is no doubt based upon this alone that he is some sort of true visionary. This is a unique film in many ways. It doesnt all work, but when it does, some of it soars. There is a tricky problem trying to read subtitles of songs while trying to watch the creativeness going on in the background, but you get the hang of it and English becomes more prominent as it goes along. This ingenious film about a cartel leader changing his sex for a couple of reasons. He wants to disappear and he has had a lifelong dream of being a woman. And he becomes one who also becomes a very good person who helps many, but she has one big flaw. Shes greedy. She got want she wanted, but she also wants what she lost, her children who believe their father is dead. This desire to have it all is the destructive force that comes late in the film. This is a gorgeous piece of filmmaking and so creative. The three principles are Zoe Saldana and Selena Gomez, both who have never been better, and Karla Sofía Gascón, a true transexual who gives as good a performance as the other two. They are all fascinating and so is this extremely original film with some mighty creative musical moments. This is a unique film..",9,5,45,0.29948275862068974,0.6018965517241379
,A waste of time,"I had a hard time watching this senseless cartoon.Just because its bold, has good cinematography, and the director is trendy among their industry friends doesnt make it a good movie.The songs are bad, the pronunciations dreadful, the acting feels like a Mexican soap opera, and there are serious timeline errors ...The sociocultural aspect shouldnt be overlooked either, as it portrays a Mexico with very outdated clichés that clearly affect the overall perception of the film and cause discomfort among the audience.Anyway, if they aimed for a farce, they achieved it-just a very bad one.",1,13,1,-0.11477777777777778,0.5476666666666666

It might not be perfect but it explores, I loved the journey.Are we willing to be ourselves at all cost?Is there something in our past that we would like to keep, and we can never let it go?Do we live celebrating our lives or constantly sacrificing for the better good?Who are we: the reflection in someone elses eyes or the person we feel inside?Is it really that different to be a man or a woman?I love a film that questions.

,Bad Movie,"I still cant understand how this extremely terrible movie managed to get 13 nominations! The Academy seriously needs to rethink this choice.Its shocking that Emelia Perez got 13 nominations. The plot is shallow, the characters lack depth, and even the performances feel uninspired. While the cinematography tries to impress, it cant hide the films flaws. The dialogue is clichéd and forgettable, making it hard to believe this movie received such acclaim. The entire production feels like an overhyped attempt to appear artistic, but it lacks soul and originality.

,One of the worst movies based on racisim and promoting it.,"I imagine this movie was made based on the own based perception of the directors. Its a joke itself. To the director, i invite you to end your career and come to Mexico for a weekend to see how happy we are all mexicans with your amazing representation. I know you guys were bored and just randomly picked topics like-- what if we make a movie about... mexico, trans community, narcos, and people whos not even mexican using based stereotypes!...A waste of time, just watch this movie to get mad if you are hispanic.And in simple words for the creators: étaler de la merde sur tout le corps est plus agréable que dessayer de regarder ce film.",1,13,1,0.019444444444444448,0.6396825396825396
,This movie is wrong in so many ways,"Watching Emilia Perez felt more like unintentional comedy than the reflective exploration of Mexicos reality it aimed to be. The portrayal of narco culture was not just poorly executed-it was downright offensive. A narco choosing to become a woman instead of dying? Completely out of the reality, with the mindset they were trying to represent.Then theres a party scene at the beginning of the movie where everyone is just lying around on a mountain. Seriously? And dont get me started on the idea of narcos listening to rap instead of banda or corridos bélicos. Its as if the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing and simply pieced together random stereotypes.One of the funniest details? The house in Las Lomas is literally on top of a hill. Its clear the creators didnt realize Las Lomas is actually the name of one of the most elite neighborhoods in Mexico City, not just a random geographic feature. That level of ignorance sums up the film perfectly.The soundtrack sounds like it was written by a 10-year-old, making it impossible to take any scene seriously. As for Selena Gomez, while some may defend her performance because English isnt her first language, it was undeniably awful. Her flat acting did nothing to elevate an already laughable script.At the end of the day, Emilia Perez fails on every possible level: poor execution, offensive stereotypes, childish songs, and terrible acting. There are so many ridiculous moments that its hard to know where to stop. Sadly, a film that could have explored meaningful themes turned into a caricature of itself.",1,13,1,-0.1511111111111111,0.5457936507936508
,An exceptional cinematic achievement,"Emilia Pérez is such a bizarre mixture of genres and styles that shouldnt work at all but it does... it works amazingly well actually. Its old fashioned, operatic yet still modern, raw and vibrant, timely and timeless at the same time, infectiously entertaining crime musical thriller that effortlessly navigates between poignant family drama, turbulent transitioning journey of a trans woman and slowly revealed story about redemption.Musical numbers are beautifully choreographed, bursting with energy at every turn and outstanding performances elevated every single one of those scenes, Zoe Saldana especially - Ive never seen her so damn good, electrifying, magnetic, heartfelt, thats definitely an Oscar-worthy performance.Emilia Pérez isnt that interested in all tiny details and complexities of trans-experience or cultural-political circumstances surrounding our characters here but rather in telling a larger than life story, a modern fable with a big beating heart right in the middle, a story told with undeniable passion, warmth and kindness. Well done!",9,5,46,0.15371048704382037,0.4720322886989554
,Worst movie of the year,"Atrocious. This movie is no more than an euro centric joke making fun of a real, huge problem of a country.It wasnt even on my radar outside from Selena doesnt know how to speak spanish but I gave it a look because they told me that was the only problem of the film, how wrong they were. As a native-speaking of the language, the songs were awfully written, none of them had sense even if any of the actresses spoke perfect Spanish .And plot wise is a spit on the cartel problem Mexico has been having for decades, we never got any reason or behind why Manitas wanted to do all this movement besides to redeem themselves as if it wasnt any other way like actually giving himself to the authorities and face the consequences of their actions as a cartel member, but oh well, we wouldnt have a trans plot which is my next point.No one in the LGBTQ+ community liked this aspect of the movie either and theres a single reason tied with what I wrote before, and its that the plot line doesnt even matter. We never see an insight or real trans problem plot point other than faking their death and make a new life , it literally just looks like if you transition you can be good now, doesnt matter what you did before and Im pretty sure thats offensive even if you dont care or are part of the community.I believe theres open to discussion on Zoes and Karlas performance since I think they are pretty decent in some parts but I think they got covered by the amount of sht the director and writers did with the plots and dialogue.I cant believe they got 13 nominations which will probably win a lot of them when even the director confessed he did not research on anything whatsoever.",1,13,1,0.10453799074488729,0.5525650594616112
,from narco-thriller to musical soap opera and back,"Jacques Audiard has never disappointed me before. Many of his films have as their main theme the search for identity and changes of identity. Many of the memorable characters in his films search for their identities or hide under false identities or have at the end of the story in the film a different identity than the one we had known them under earlier. This is also the case with Emilia Pérez , one of the films that made a sensation and also collected awards at this years Cannes Film Festival. It is an interesting and original combination of a film about the Mexican mafia and social and political criticism, of soap opera and musical. The story takes place most of the time in Mexico, but the filming took place in France. The cast is international and the film is spoken and sung in Spanish, although the director is not fluent in the language. Emilia Pérez is a film that divided the opinions of critics and also divides the opinions of the audiences to extremes. I am one of those who liked this movie a lot.The film begins as a narco-thriller, continues as a sci-fi musical, moves into melodrama with social overtones and ends as a narco-thriller, coming full circle. Along the way, we will have the opportunity to follow the transformation of two main characters: an insecure lawyer who cannot make her way in a world dominated by men, and a gangster who wants to lose his trace and identity. Both characters want to transform into something else entirely. The transformations are radical and there is no going back.The main criticism leveled at the film is perhaps justified. Apparently its about Mexico, with the violence of a society based on drug trafficking and kidnapping, but the rendering seems to be based on stereotypes about Mexico rather than reality. There are plenty of other films, including those by Mexican filmmakers, that present a much more humane, more complex, more nuanced picture. The directors attention is focused on the relationships between four women who love and hate, suffer and try to realize themselves in a world that oppresses them. We are witnessing a family drama that does not shy away from melodrama, but we are definitely in the land of soap operas. Of the four characters and performers who received an interesting collective award for female performance at Cannes, that of the lawyer Rita played by Zoe Saldana and that of Karla Sofía Gascón as the gangster Manitas del Monte turned Emilia Pérez I think stand out. Characters from Almodovars films immediately come to mind, but here I think both the story and the character are much more complex. Can gender transformation also lead to a complete personality transformation? It is the central question related to the heroine of the film, and I think the answer will be given by each of the viewers. The artistic vehicle of this question is an emotional captivating story, told in an original and engaging style. Emilia Pérez is the second film in a few months that proves that the musical genre is alive. The other is Joker 2. Both movies have their fans and their critics. Proof of vitality.",9,5,47,0.12584745762711863,0.4135593220338982
,Worst movie to ever get an Oscars nomination?,"I have seen worse movies. Even this month I have, sadly, seen worse than this. However this is definitely a top contender for the worst movie to ever get an Oscars nomination, let alone 13 of them.First of all the Spanish from Selena is even to me, as speaking Spanish as my third language, really bad. If I can notice it... well... Secondly this is very badly edited. It feels more like a bunch of scenes jumbled together rather than a nice flowing story.The sound design, and the songs are mostly bad. That this movie got a nomination for best original song is probably the biggest error in the Oscars entire history.With that said a few of the singing performances, despite the actual music/songs, was still very good. One of the reasons I am not trashing this completely is that the acting is solid and a few of the music numbers is very good. Another good thing about this movie is the great cinematography - minus the editing and directing which is deeply flawed. The script and general story is interesting and pretty original - this could probably have been a good movie if it wasnt for all the problems this movie has.My main issue here is the flow, the pacing, the actual scene-by-scene depiction of the story. It does not work. The dialogue feels weird, and forced. The song numbers, although performed well, do not really work as a narrative tool. The acting, although solid, is also nothing special. And all of this combined with the weird editing make this a hard movie to watch. This feels more like a school play rather than a movie.I think it is a shame actually. This is a interesting take and original story which with the right director and better actors and better dialogue could have been very good. As is I give this a 3/10, and I can not recommend this.The Oscars this year will hit new lows comes to viewership, and this is yet another movie that will further the decline of Hollywood.",3,24,4,0.10180401416765053,0.47821251475796933
,"""Emilia Pérez: A Cringe-Inducing, Stereotype-Filled Disaster That Fails at Everything""","Emilia Pérez is an absolute disaster of a movie, a baffling mess that fails in almost every conceivable way. It tries to be a musical, a crime drama, and a social commentary all at once-but instead, it ends up as a chaotic, cringe-worthy spectacle that drags on for what feels like an eternity.1. Stereotypes: Instead of offering an authentic portrayal, the film throws together every lazy, surface-level cliché about Mexico-tequila, sombreros, and skulls-without any depth or originality. The setting feels less like a real place and more like a cheap postcard version of the country, making everything feel fake and forced.2. Performances: The acting ranges from overly dramatic to completely lifeless, with no consistency in tone. Some actors seem to think theyre in a serious drama, while others behave like theyre in a parody. The result? A jarring, awkward viewing experience where no performance feels natural or convincing.3. Script and Songs: The dialogue is laughably bad, filled with forced, preachy lines that sound more like a high school play than a professional screenplay. The songs? Unbearable. They pop up out of nowhere, disrupt the pacing, and add absolutely nothing to the story. Instead of enhancing emotions, they make already dull scenes even worse.Overall, Emilia Pérez is a confused, pretentious train wreck that fails at everything it attempts.

,Good not perfect. Important? Maybe,"I see a lot of reviews from people who say they are Mexican and are somewhat offended by things about the movie: specifically the accents and the representation of the drug war in Mexico. To them I say: this is not a documentary. Im sure that Yonkers of 1898 is not accurately represented in Hello! Dolly, nor does Mary Poppins portray 1910 London, nor Les Miserables revolutionary France. Like those films, ITS A MUSICAL!I also see members of the trans community complaining that it doesnt represent the trans experience accurately. While trans woman Amelia Hansford pans the film in Pink News, she also provides the clearest explanation of what the movie IS about, which is not the accurate and complex process of transition, when she writes: Emilia Pérez is primarily a film about being reborn, and it tries to use the idea of transitioning to convey that through her transition, Emilia is trying to repent for the sins she committed in her time as cartel boss. The issue with this is that transition isnt a moral decision, and the act of transitioning alone doesnt somehow absolve you of your past self.Im not transgender, nor am I Mexican , so my review is through a cis, white filter. I am not fluent in Spanish, but I was able to understand all of the speakers regardless of accent. People with more personal lived experiences will view this film through a different and more discerning lens, of course.That said, I havent liked the music in most recent musicals that didnt originate onstage. Call me old fashioned but I like songs with memorable sing-along melodies and lyrics). And Emilia Perez falls into that category. The songs are moody, and advance the story, but not in a way that leaves you haunted by a melody, except possibly the final song.What is haunting is the story of redemption and its limitations. Manitas did a lot of bad stuff, as we hear about in more detail mid-way through the film. As Emilia, there is a change from regret to actively trying to provide some closure for the loved ones of victims. But violence is never far away and the adages live by the sword, die by the sword and a leopard doesnt change its spots are concepts present in Emilias new life.Zoe Saldaña is given the most to do with her role, and despite the movies title, she shines as the star. Karla Sofia Gascón is courageous, alternately vulnerable and cold as she embodies both Manitas and Emilia. Adriana Paz has a great first couple of scenes but is underutilized until she finally gets her moment in the best song of the movie.Is Emilia Perez groundbreaking? In any other year, I might not think so. But one week into a new US presidential administration that is equating sex with gender and focusing on migrants from south of the USA, perhaps it is a more important film than it ever intended.",8,3,22,0.1489295125164691,0.5086517347386912

,"A showstopper, but...","Cinematically impressive, hugely imaginative and ambitious, with an intricate screenplay full of shifting loyalties and waves of suspense, Emilia Pérez captivated me for two hours. Unfortunately, it goes on for more than two hours.The musical numbers serve to minimize the brutal content without diminishing the emotional impact, even though the songs arent particularly memorable. An exception is El Mal, the song and dance sequence at the banquet, with an extraordinary performance by Zoe Saldana, enhanced by superb choreography, filming, and editing. It seems almost unfair to single Saldana out above Selena Gomez and Karla Sofía Gascón, all three deliver, but El Mal is almost a showstopper.I wont spoil the ending. Lets just say that it all wraps up entirely too quickly, leaving me thinking that writer/director Jacques Audiard and his team couldnt think of a more resonant and fulfilling ending.",8,3,22,0.19001322751322752,0.6716269841269841

,An Operatic Triumph,"Emilia Perez is an intense and captivating work where emotions, music, and storytelling intertwine to create a truly unique experience. Much like Opera, the film invites the viewer to surrender entirely to its magic, embracing its conventions: singing as a narrative vehicle, theatrical gestures, and the apparent implausibility of the plot. This surrender is not an end in itself but opens the door to a deeper truth-the emotions and feelings that drive the characters.The four protagonists, each with their own story and struggles, embody a universal fight against an oppressive fate, driven by a yearning for freedom. Their journey does not always lead to catharsis, but it leaves an indelible mark on the audiences heart. Just as in lyrical melodrama, the film elevates human passions to a universal level, transforming the emotional journey of its characters into a shared and profoundly moving experience.In this space suspended between reality and artifice, Emilia Perez emerges as a fascinating exploration of the power of emotions and the redemptive capacity of true Art.",8,3,22,0.19166666666666665,0.5661764705882353
,emmm the execution was not it,"First of all, the premise was not bad. However, the execution was pretty awful and i consider that this didnt deserve the awards given comparing them to other movies released during 2024. The songs sounded really weird to me, I know they tackled actual problems but I didnt find it enjoyable. Some people are defending this movie saying that it was not made for mexicans, the one that are criticizing the movie the most. But the lack of research and how poorly the themes were touched although i dont say they are not true, justify that I rate this movie a 1/10. Personally, I didnt connect with Emilia Perez or understood why he turned into a woman, what i understood is that Manitas wanted to change because he wanted to escape from his mistakes as a drug dealer or something like that not because he started to identify himself as a women, which basically promoted that escaping from your problems and from consequences of your actions doesnt seem appropriate for me, I know they tried something like a redemption arch but without justice Emilia Perez couldnt really think about his actions and regret it a lot which is what is supposed to be presented in order to actually empathize with the character.",2,16,2,0.023333333333333324,0.5283333333333332

Its an insult to art and intelligence. I have seen isis execution videos that are more entertaining than this film. Zoe Saldana I think could be a really good musical actress but she decided to perform in this garbage. Its melodic speaking at best.

,Disappointing and disrespectful.,"Emilia Pérez attempts to portray the reality of Mexico but fails miserably. As a Mexican, I find it offensive to see how our culture is distorted and caricatured in a film that lacks authenticity, research, and respect for what it truly means to be Mexican.First and foremost, the cast leaves much to be desired in terms of representation. Its inconceivable that for a movie supposedly about Mexico, only one actress is Mexican, while the rest of the cast consists of actors from other nationalities who clearly do not speak Spanish fluently. Their unnatural delivery and forced pronunciation make the dialogues feel artificial and unconvincing, undermining any chance of immersing the audience in the story.The script is another weak point. Its evident that it was poorly translated, possibly using tools like Google Translate, resulting in clumsy, incoherent, and emotionless lines. The songs featured in the movie are equally disastrous: they lack rhyme, are poorly translated, and feature melodies that seem to have been created without any understanding of Mexican traditional or contemporary music.The portrayal of Mexican culture in this film is shallow and stereotypical. Its clear that the director didnt take the time to research or grasp the richness and complexity of Mexico. This leads to settings, costumes, and scenarios that fail to reflect the countrys true essence, instead coming across as a foreign and condescending perspective based on outdated clichés.Moreover, the protagonists attitude toward Mexico and its people is unacceptable. Her arrogance and disrespectful comments further deepen the disconnect between the film and its intended audience.In summary, Emilia Pérez is not only a poorly executed film but also an insult to those of us who live in and love Mexico. The lack of authentic representation, the disregard for language accuracy, and the deficiencies in the script, music, and direction make it a prime example of how NOT to portray a culture. If the goal is to create cinema that celebrates and represents Mexico, its essential to work with teams that respect and understand what being Mexican truly means.",1,16,2,-0.10825143325143327,0.4502252252252253
,A bold and transformative story of identity and redemption,"Emilia Pérez , directed by Jacques Audiard, is a visually stunning and emotionally gripping film that tells the story of Emilia, a former cartel kingpin who undergoes gender-affirming surgery to transition into her true self. The film follows Emilias journey as she leaves her dangerous past behind and enlists Rita , an overworked lawyer, to help her fake her death and start anew as a humanitarian. The narrative is both thrilling and heartfelt, exploring themes of identity, redemption, and the courage it takes to embrace ones true self.Karla Sofía Gascón delivers a powerhouse performance in the dual role of Emilia and her former self, Manitas del Monte, a ruthless cartel leader. Gascóns portrayal is layered and nuanced, capturing the stark contrasts between the hardened criminal and the compassionate woman Emilia strives to become. Her transformation is central to the films emotional core, as Gascón skillfully navigates the extremes of the characters personality. The film also benefits from the star power of Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez, who bring their own depth to their roles, particularly in the vibrant, song-and-dance sequences that punctuate the film.Audiards direction is bold and inventive, using striking visuals and music to convey the emotional weight of Emilias journey. The films colorful, soul-infused musical numbers are a stark contrast to the gritty, tense drama that unfolds as Emilia fights to leave behind her criminal past. The cinematography enhances this contrast, juxtaposing the beauty and freedom of Emilias new life with the darker, more oppressive moments from her history.The films pacing moves between intense action sequences and quieter, more reflective moments, giving space for the characters inner struggles to unfold. The emotional stakes are high, especially as Emilias past life continues to haunt her, forcing her to confront both external threats and her own identity. The performances, especially from Gascón, are riveting, ensuring that Emilia Pérez is both a compelling drama and a celebration of personal transformation.While the film delivers a powerful message about redemption and self-acceptance, the narrative may feel overwhelming for some due to its intense shifts between genres and the complex nature of its characters. Additionally, the sensitive themes surrounding identity and transition are explored in ways that may require careful attention to fully appreciate the depth of the storytelling.Rating: 8/10. A bold and transformative film that showcases a powerful performance and explores themes of identity, redemption, and the pursuit of happiness, though its intensity may challenge some viewers.",8,3,22,0.07306948798328108,0.631658829676071
,"It was supposed to be good, but...","Ill start by saying Im not a big fan of musicals but there are some I really like , and I also want to say Zoe Saldana is one of my favorite actresses. That being said I really want to understand why everyone seems to ignore all the problems involved in this movie. I also want to say that I couldnt even get past the middle of the movie, and one of the main problems in my opnion yes is the language or especifically how they deal with the lamguage in this film. Does any critic who watched this movie speak Spanish? It doesnt seem much but language is a very important aspect of any movie, it puts credibility on what is being said, it creates emotion that only people who understand this language will be able to express and yet here is a movie placing american actresses pretending to speak Spanish and not succeeding in their attempts. Im not a native in Spanish myself but I study languages and I do know when they seem fake and plain, and this is how this movie feels in my opinion. The plot is actually interesting, but an interesting plot in wrong hands, can become a disaster, I felt like I was watching a really bad dubbed soap opera. Probably the only good aspect of this movie is letting the amazing Karla Sofia Gascon shine, but for being the main character I thought she deserved a lot more screen time. I feel like if this plot was given to a director or producers who knows better then we would have the great movie I expected to watch.",2,37,9,0.1263015873015873,0.4938492063492063
,Explores the transformation of body AND soul,"I simply cant stop talking about this film to everyone I know. If Emilia Perez does not win Best Original Screenplay for 2024, and, at the very least, garner nominations for Karla Sofía Gascón as Emilia/Manitas and Zoe Saldaña as Rita, then the film industry still has some evolutionary progress ahead.Its being billed as a musical/comedy, but its not that at all - its so much more. Basically, the story is about a Mexican drug cartel leader named Manitas Del Monte. Hes a killer. He destroys lives and families. Hes married to Jessi and has two young children.Manitas is also desperate to change his life. I mean, completely - he wants to become a woman and has been undergoing hormone therapy for a long time. He hires Rita, an underappreciated attorney in Mexico, to help him find a surgeon somewhere in the world who can be paid enough to keep his secret, do the head to toe transformational surgery, and help him fake his own death to complete his escape.Yes, when I tell people just that much about the film, their reaction is always WHAT????Rita is toiling away in a job where her fellow attorneys, all men, steal her work, her glory and her financial rewards. Thinking shes heading to a meeting with a client, Manitas men kidnap Rita, throw a sack over her head, then drive her to a one-on-one with the drug lord. Shes positive shes going to be killed at any moment. Instead, Manitas lays out his whole unbelieveable plan to her, including the multimillion dollar paycheck shell receive for helping him.Rita agrees, at first reluctantly. She travels around the globe, researching and interviewing various plastic surgeons. Eventually she embraces the entire plan. Not only because she sees how much the money will be able to free her from her own life of being near penniless. But also because she begins to care for Manitas, as a friend, begins to trust him. Manitas adores his family, and its obvious throughout the film that his choice was exceedingly difficult. He has a plan. He has Rita convince Jessi that she and their chidren must flee the country to keep them safe, because there is a drug war on the horizon.And heres the kicker - its all done in the style of Evita. That is, its an operetta. Not a straight-up musical. There are no Oklahoma-style song and dance numbers, where the action stops and the high kicks start. And its not British satire such as youd find in a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. Its more that the main characters are talking to themselves, thinking out loud, and then they start to walk the streets and start singing their thoughts, with the people surrounding them joining in. To me, the final scenes of Emilia Perez are especially reminiscent of Evita. And, of course, theres the similarity in that Evita Peron, over the course of her rise and fall, transformed herself many times.Jessi experiences her own tranformation. We are first introduced to her as the pampered wife of Manitas, mother to his children. She wants for nothing. Shes exceedingly unlikeable. However, though she certainly knows hes a killer, she apparently is in the dark regarding Manitas desire to become a woman. She is heartbroken when informed of his death. A few years pass and Emilia, with Ritas help, moves Jessi and the children into Emilias own home, introducing herself as a distant relative to Manitas.Jessis own transformation begins when she tires of being a bit player in her own life. She eventually makes moves to step out of the life to which that Manitas has her confined.Narrative-wise, there is an early reveal in the film, between Rita and Manitas, which is the only part that struck me as illogical. Not because of the reveal itself, but how is it possible that Jessi didnt know? Didnt notice what was physically going on with her husband? Yes, she is definitely quite self-absorbed. But that doesnt explain away the plot hole.Yes, its a film about the transformation of the body. But in the case of Emilia herself, its a complete tranformation of her soul as well. Theres so much more story here, but I dont want to give the plot away. And whether shes portraying Emilia or Manitas, Karla Sofía Gascón give us an electric performance. Director Jacques Audiard has given audiences one hell of a telenovela.",9,5,48,0.12062654012654009,0.5109905094905095
,"I thought the worst movie of the year was Madame Web, but I was wrong","Usually I can understand why people like a movie, even if I dont. Emilia Perez is so incompetent, so bad in every way, that I cannot understand anyone liking it. The Spanish is incredibly bad, the musical numbers are boring and poorly choreographed and staged, the plot is nonsensical, and none of the characters act like real people.Trans people suffer enough in life between dysphoria, discrimination, and the constant threat of regressive laws. They dont deserve this movie, too. Thats the kind of torture even Prometheus would think, thank Zeus I dont have to suffer that badly.Madame Web is a horrible movie, but at least it has a sense that someone somewhere involved in the production cared about the characters and subject of the film Emilia Perez is the work of someone who doesnt care about trans people, believes every racist characterization of Mexico, and has clearly never seen a musical in their lives. Its a poorly acted, poorly filmed, dreary movie without a point or reason to exist.

,No love or care has gone into this script - it's as under-cooked as films come,"Each year I watch all the Oscar nominated films, and I dont always love or even enjoy all of them, however I can almost always see why they would at least be nominated. That is not the case for Emilia Pérez. This film is sloppy, under-developed and frankly insulting at times. Surely the political pull of centering your film around a trans-gender person doesnt have this kind of influence?I mean the transgender element of the film was as under-cooked as anything youll ever see in a movie. It was just this person was a man, now they are a woman. And thats that. No aspects of them dealing with it are touched on. It was basically just a plot device by the end.As for it being a musical, I feel like that was used to cover up how weak the story was. Musicals dont seem to have the same demands on them as other movies, and so chucking that in there lets them get away with just how basic everything is.The morals of the movie are truly bizarre as well. The lead character is a ruthless cartel leader and yet we are supposed to support them because - they changed gender? Absolutely nothing is ever done to make us side with them. We are just told that we should and that is that.There is no loving care thats gone into this script. It feels like a first draft, and a pretty dodgy one at that. I did not like this movie much.

Its unlike anything ever seen before, and all the leads were great--especially Karla Sofía Gascón as both Manitas and Emilia . She certainly earns all the acclaim she has gotten for the role, but Zoe Saldaña and the other leads also deserve acclaim as well.

The use of autotune and mismatched voices only adds to the cringe factor. The acting is equally poor, with the main actors failing to deliver authentic performances.

,Wrong representation and overall choices make this picture unworthy of award wins/nominations,"Manitas wants to get out of the drug business by changing his sex, meaning he wants to become a woman. Even though by doing that he is risking his own family. But what does it matter anyway. He enlists the help of laywer, Rita .What follows is a pointless series of cringe inducing events that lead to an anti-climactic and worthless ending.Karla Sofía Gascóns non existent Mexican accent is awful. Her Spanish accent greatly shows. There were a lot of other possible and well capable Mexican actresses of taking upon the role of Manitas but the role went to a relatively high profile actress, who is a transgender in real life as well. Apart from her terrible attempt at mimicking an actual Mexican accent from the Ciudad de Mexico region, shes doing okay at playing the character she was assigned to. At least she omitted the ths.Zoe Zaldanas origin isnt Mexican, shes actually Dominican, but her accent represents, somewhat at least, a Latin American one. Shes by far the most interesting actress and she has experience with being in high profile productions. She is convincing at playing the empathetic and helpful lawyer that desires a positive change for her local community.Selena Gomezs accent and gravitas is non-existent. Shes stumbling and terrible at doing a Latin American Spanish accent as she was born in the States and thus her native language isnt Spanish. She cant act either for the most part.The movie is part drama part musical and horrible at both. Its baffling to see so many wins and nominations that it got. This movie has some very peculiar things going on. A French director that clearly wasnt that invested in the Mexican culture filmed the movie in France anyway and made it part musical and part drama. The musical scenes are for the most part just, bad and ridiculous.At an attempt to win awards, this movie was born and sadly got some of them in the end, without clearly deserving of them.

,A dark stain on filmmaking,"Shame on Jacques Audiard. This film is so incoherent. Watching it feels like being trapped in a never-ending loop of mediocrity, where every scene is more meaningless than the last. Every character is a walking cliché, and every line of dialogue is a painful reminder that someone thought this was worth producing. While the film falters on nearly every front, the way it mishandles cultural representation via its abysmal acting deserves special attention. We see a cast that, frankly, fails to bring any depth, authenticity, or respect to their roles. And while this isnt uncommon in films where actors merely touch the surface, in this case, its particularly harmful. Because it has the audacity to try and represent cultures that deserve far better than lazy stereotypes and cringe-worthy attempts at emotional depth.",1,11,1,-0.006309523809523809,0.4644047619047619

That obligation may not have put me in the right mood. Neither does the musical. Oh yeah! Surprise! Its a musical. I am getting a little tired of the surprise musical. The songs are a bit darker. This is no Disney singalong. As for actors, I dont know Karla. She has some acting power. The Americans are doing Spanish which I rarely see them do. I dont speak it. I cant judge any of that or quite frankly the dialogue. I would only say that this should be Emilias story from start to finish. She is the center and the most interesting character. I have nothing against Zoe Saldana. Shes a great actress, but this really should start with Emilia. The story has a bit too much Mrs. Doubtfire.

,Big Swing But Equally Big Miss,"About half way through Emilia Perez I had decided it really wasnt a very good movie, but I was going to give it credit for going big. But by the time it was over, I really disliked it so much that I no longer cared how big a swing it took. Audacious movies also have to meet a certain threshold of good in order to be enjoyable.This film is like three different ideas crammed into one movie, and none of them successfully co-exists with the others. Part of this is a Sicario-like drug cartel crime drama, part is an Almodovar-like melodrama, and the third is a musical. I never felt like I was watching a coherent movie, but rather like I was watching a bunch of experimental parts of different movies that someone awkwardly stitched together. I especially dont know why its a musical, since the songs arent really even songs, and anyway they dont do anything but rehash what characters already said in a preceding dialogue scene.Three of the actresses are getting awards attention for this. In fact, the movie is getting serious Best Picture nomination buzz, which boggles my mind. The acting is ok, I guess, but its hard to really appreciate acting when its in the context of something that doesnt work any better than this movie does. Zoe Saldana is the standout, giving a lively and fully committed performance, even if her character and the journey she goes on doesnt make any sense.Not being transgender or Mexican myself, Im willing to concede that perhaps I was lacking personal experiences needed to truly appreciate this movie. But shouldnt good art be able to help us see the world through the eyes of someone very different from us and help us to recognize in it things that resonate? Isnt that the point of art in the first place?No, I mostly think I didnt like this movie because its not very good.Grade: C-",4,23,5,0.1567245670995671,0.40911904761904755
,"A Surprising Gem - ""Emilia Pérez""","*Emilia Pérez* was an unexpected delight that truly took me by surprise. Initially, I was drawn to the movie purely because of its intriguing premise-a crime boss seeking to transition and the journey that follows. I was curious to see how the director would turn such a unique storyline into a compelling film. Little did I know, I was in for a cinematic treat.From the very first few minutes, the movie hooked me. The directors expressive storytelling techniques and creative vision made the narrative come alive in ways I didnt anticipate. The pacing was masterful, and the transitions between the plots key moments were seamless, keeping me engaged throughout.The performances were another standout aspect. The cast delivered outstanding portrayals, adding layers of depth and emotion to their characters. The lead actor was particularly impressive, bringing a perfect balance of vulnerability and strength to the role. Their performance made the protagonists journey not only believable but deeply moving.What struck me most was how the film balanced its unconventional premise with universal themes of identity, transformation, and self-acceptance. Its not just a story about a crime boss or transitioning-its a story about humanity, and it resonated on a deeply emotional level.Overall, *Emilia Pérez* exceeded my expectations in every way. From the storytelling to the performances, its a film that dares to be bold and original while remaining heartfelt and relatable. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for something fresh, surprising, and genuinely inspiring.",9,4,37,0.27926820728291313,0.6357352941176471

,"Jack of all trades, master of none","Rita is a lawyer struggling with her conscience after a defense case who receives a mysterious call for a lucrative opportunity that leads her to drug lord Juan Manitas Del Monte . His desire to undergo sex reassignment surgery and fake his death is the reason for Ritas involvement, a job that will make her rich and let Manitas reborn as Emilia Pérez.Directed by Jacques Audiard, the movie thematically illustrates gender and redemption. Following a life that made it difficult for Manitas to be her true self, she is more willing than ever to make her dream a reality, La vida que la propia vida se encargó de no darme . By undergoing gender-affirming surgery, she faces significant implications, as Rita puts it in the song Lady, Changing the body changes society. Changing society changes the soul. Changing the soul changes society. Changing society changes it all. The movies take on gender avoids biological determinism and treats it as performative and, therefore, offers a look that does not judge and invites reflection upon a topic that is still controversial.As a way to amend her wrongs and redeem herself, Emilia creates a nonprofit to identify bodies of cartel victims, La lucecita. This opens up the door to explore the sociocultural reality in Mexico and the prevalence cartels have. It also provides the story for more songs to be included. Songs that differ in terms of quality, where on one end of the spectrum we have Todo y nada and on the other Para. The reasons are simple: despite one song being better than the other, Zoe Saldana can sing, while some of the singers in that choral song cannot. One song during the gala stands out but not by reason of it being good; on the contrary, it promotes violence and sexual abuse because Rita is unmasking corrupt donors of the nonprofit, but instead of leading by example, she reproduces violence as a way to fight against what she deems repudiable.Ultimately, Emilia Pérez has an interesting concept that is lost in its far-reaching aspirations, leading to unsatisfying results where not even the songs can save it since, besides Todo y nada, its soundtrack is not precisely one that you would like to listen to again. To aggravate things further, an uneven execution renders it a dense and boring experience devoid of much value. It has its moments, mostly due to Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofía Gascón, whose performances standout, but those moments never justify a film as such. You know the movie is not good when looking at your phone or going to make yourself a coffee are tempting activities to avoid watching what is onscreen.",3,33,9,0.04017857142857141,0.5728741496598639

,This movie does not deserve such nonsense nominations,"*Emilia Pérez* is a film that, unfortunately, leaves much to be desired in almost all its aspects. First of all, the script is weak and predictable, lacking originality and depth in the dialogues. The plot seems to try to mix various genres without managing to integrate them in a coherent way, resulting in a feeling of confusion and lack of focus.Regarding the direction, there is a great lack of rhythm and tension. The scenes feel long and empty, without the necessary impact to hook the viewer. The dramatic moments fall into the forced, and the film fails to convey any genuine emotion. The construction of characters is deficient, since the actors do not have quality material to develop their roles in a convincing way.On the other hand, the performances are regrettable. Despite having a cast that could have potential, the interpretations feel flat, without authenticity, which contributes to the disconnection that the public experiences with the story. The characters motivations are confusing and, in many cases, lack logic, making the decisions they make seem implausible.The aesthetics of the film also leave much to be desired. The production design and photography are bland, with no remarkable visual proposition. The soundtrack, instead of accompanying the atmosphere, feels out of place, with a selection of songs that contribute nothing to the narrative.In short, *Emilia Pérez* is a film that fails on all fronts: script, direction, acting, and visual aspect. It offers nothing new or interesting, and its only achievement is to be quickly forgotten once it ends.The Direction is an Ignorant, there are million ways for a better representation of trans community and Mexican culture.",1,17,3,0.014992025518341312,0.46349681020733663

,Downright disrespectful,"For a story about a trans woman, the writing reeks of a lack of genuine lived experience or consultation with the trans community. Emilias journey is reduced to tired tropes, treating her identity as a plot device rather than a complex and nuanced aspect of her humanity. The shows attempts at humor often punch down, perpetuating harmful stereotypes rather than challenging them. At best, its cringe-inducing; at worst, its actively damaging.The Latinx representation fares no better. Cultural elements are cherry-picked and exaggerated to create an aesthetic of spicy exoticism, stripping the characters and setting of authenticity. The result feels more like a caricature for non-Latinx audiences to gawk at than an earnest portrayal of Latinx culture.Perhaps most egregious is how the musicals creators seemed more focused on appealing to cisgender and non-Latinx audiences than doing justice to the communities theyre depicting. The lack of care is evident in the writing, the direction, and even the music, which flattens cultural richness into generic beats meant to be accessible. Representation isnt just about visibility-its about respect, depth, and intentionality, none of which Emilia Perez delivers.At a time when authentic representation is more important than ever, Emilia Perez is a glaring reminder of how performative allyship can do more harm than good. Instead of being a celebration, it feels like an appropriation-a shiny façade with no real soul.",1,15,3,0.17944444444444446,0.5105555555555555
,Se robo mi lana,"Full of amazing artistic scenes, one shot takes that show off great choreography, it is clear that lots of work and failed attempts went onto making some of these scenes come to life and Emilia Perez is great at that. At some times amusing at how clever the songs rhymed.Unfortunately as for the rest of the things in the movie, I wasnt particularly too fond of them. The musical scenes go on for longgggg periods of time, in some moments where I felt the slightest tension or seriousness, it was completely gone the moment threatening words were being hummed. I get that making things overly serious may not have been the intent, but the story isnt exactly what youd call lighthearted so it didnt sit well with me.Now what I really wanted to get into was the performances, I am not an actor so I dont like talking about when actors dont do so well but it was rough to sit through at times, Selena Gomez clearly gave so much to the role but as someone who speaks Spanish, lets just say it unfortunately did not sound great, completely unnatural and at times even laughable.With so much attention that it got in the golden globes I was very much let down. This is definitely not the worse movie Ive seen even in the last thirty days, but it was for sure the hardest to stomach through, getting the feeling of wanting to walk out on a movie in the theater is something Ive felt before, but theres definitely something wrong if I felt like walking out my own house.",2,12,2,0.14228758169934635,0.5163071895424836
,"If you're not a Spanish speaker or Mexican , you will Enjoy","I believe the reason for the negative reviews is the inaccurate Spanish accent and Mexican culture reflected in the movie. Sure, its a flaw, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and didnt expect that because I am not typically a fan of musicals. Despite these issues, including the Trans Agenda which I am against, the film offers a fun and emotional experience with a mix of drama. The acting was exceptional, especially Zoe and Karla who delivered powerful performances that truly brought their characters to life. They added depth and nuance to the story, making it more engaging. The songs were really good too and have definitely been added to my playlist. Overall, if you can overlook the cultural inaccuracies and focus on the emotional journey and strong acting, youll find this movie to be an enjoyable watch.",9,3,26,0.20797101449275363,0.466183574879227

,Amazing! 10/10,"A Heartfelt Look at Emilia PerezEmilia Perez is an unexpected delight that blends humor, heart, and the transformative power of love and self-discovery. At the center of this vibrant story is Selena Gomez, whose performance is nothing short of captivating.Selena steps into her role with a magnetic energy that lights up the screen. She brings depth and charm to her character, making it impossible not to root for her. Her comedic timing is impeccable, yet she effortlessly transitions into moments of vulnerability that feel genuine and heartfelt. Selena proves once again that shes not just a pop sensation but a versatile actress capable of commanding the big screen.The films narrative is bold and refreshing, taking on themes of identity and reinvention with a playful yet meaningful approach. The vibrant visuals and catchy soundtrack add layers of personality, making Emilia Perez a feast for both the eyes and ears.Its a testament to Selenas growing legacy in Hollywood. If youre a fan of heartfelt comedies with a touch of quirkiness-or just want to witness Selena Gomez shine-Emilia Perez is a must-watch. Its a story that will make you laugh, reflect, and leave the theater with a smile.",10,5,56,0.18749999999999997,0.5391666666666667
,This film will be getting its own MST3000 episode,"I was looking forward to seeing this film because of all the hype it received at the Globes. I expected something revelatory, something artful. Im a fan of most of the cast, and the concept really intrigued me. But it was shockingly bad. Our viewing party literally burst out in laughter on numerous occasions because of how cheesy, self important, and hacky some of the scenes felt. It felt like community theater in its best moments. The songs are absolutely dreadful. I felt myself getting uncomfortable for the actors that had to perform these numbers. Not to mention the choreography. Truly garbage. The decisions by many of the characters were perplexing, causing one not to care what happens to them. We wanted to turn it off several times but we kept holding out hope that it would improve. Nope.

,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"Emilia Pérez is a very mistaken, very problematic movie that tries to tackle complex ideas but completely misses on its own execution. Instead of providing an incisive portrait of the life of its protagonist, it resorts to damaging clichés - especially around the critique of Mexican culture - and pushes a patronizing and simplistic narrative model of gender transition as an escape from ones past sins.Anyhow, the plot boils down to Emília, a man-turned-woman with a violent and drug cartel boss past to evade. This creative decision not only cheapens the weight of gender identity, but also turns a deeply meaningful and life-altering act into a plot device - one that feels more like an effort to excuse all the characters previous transgressions. Its a tonedeaf representation that promotes poisonous stereotypes about who commits crimes - and when - and what the process of transition looks like, as if its to run away from - instead of a deep, complex exercise in selfhood.The cast are, frankly, awful in Emilia Pérez and the actresses having an appalling time trying to find depth in nothing. The actor playing the lead, especially, gives a stilted and unilluminating performance. Without any real emotion or bond with the character, it is impossible for the audience to relate to her or even understand her journey. To make matters worse, the majority of the cast, while starring in a film presumably about Mexican culture, dont even speak Spanish fluently. And it all adds a dimension of boondoggle to an already very weak story which further alienates the viewer from any sense of cultural realism or emotional integrity.The movies reliance on cliched caricatures - as opposed to a nuanced representation of Mexican characters - is its most conspicuous problem. Emília finds herself surrounded by only shallow, one-dimensional characters, mere embodiments of crime, poverty and violence. As such, these overly heroic or villainous visages do not speak to any ugly assumptions made of Mexican communities - rather, they reinforce those ugly assumptions through broad and dishonest strokes across an entire culture.All in all, Emilia Pérez is a failed story that completely misunderstands the experience of trans people and Mexican culture. Marie Noëlle: Kill Shot is a serious film that deals with fairly serious subject matter, so shallow its treatment of both gender transition and crime that it stuns the mind to think one could be made to brainless effect - and its poor performances, its lack of cultural authenticity - takes it from bad to the must-avoid section of the cinema schedule. Its more like a missed opportunity than anything to recommend, and its dependence on stereotypes and one-note characters is a disservice at every turn.",1,9,1,-0.10901559454191034,0.5094541910331385

Selena had to learn Spanish for this, and although it wasnt the best, Zoe and Karla were truly the stars of this.Its powerful and shows corruption in government .Its heart breaking.

,"Besides being apologist to narcos, and its humiliating message about trans people: this movie is bad in any sense.","1. Worst character development: one scene Zoe Saldana is singing against EP actions and right away shes congratulating her for her amazing altruistic work. Meanwhile Manitas and Emilia Pérez are the same.2. Horrible music. No rhythm, laughable lyrics, awkward choreographies, notes that the actors couldnt reach...3. The editing is horrible. Theres no personality in this visual storytelling, theres no color plate that has congruence, the frames are so strange sometimes youre seeing a documentary, next youre seeing a drama, then theres some sort of soap opera shots and dialogues as well added plots.4. Everything happens extremely fast , we never see Emilias kidnapping. We never see a mind struggling for Emilia, and I can keep counting the amount of things that suddenly appeared.5. The special effects were awful. That car explosion was laughable and ridiculous. Also, the scene where Saldaña is talking on the phone with Gómez and Gascón was terribly edited, shot and with terrible added effects like a rainbow light appearing in the frames.6. The dialogue makes no sense at all.7. Everything feels unrealistic and inauthentic. The elements that were supposed to be Mexican didnt make sense at all. In the residence you can see palms and theres no palms in México City its not the beach, theres no cárcel in our vocabulary , also the World Trade Center neighborhood where Saldaña lives is nothing like the streets they presented here. Well, Nothing about México is realistic, thats why the movie is laughable, theres no way you actually believe they are in Mexico.8. A fact from México you should know: Mothers who are searching for their missing relatives and children, are in fact persecuted by narcos , they dont allow them to search for their relatives. Is a messed up thing to see Audiards DISGUSTING intentions to make the mothers work along with the same criminals that killed their children: disgusting, unbelievable, disrespectful... ugh.This movie is ridiculous in any level.

,I'm confused...,"Emilia Pérez had potential, but wow, did it miss the mark. What was supposed to be a gripping crime drama with a unique premise turned into a confusing, overindulgent, and emotionally hollow experience.The film tries to blend crime, music, and social commentary, but instead of creating something powerful, it feels like a mismatched jumble of ideas that never fully click. The pacing is all over the place, making it difficult to stay engaged. One moment its a serious cartel drama, the next its trying to be a heartfelt musical, and neither side gets the attention it deserves.The performances are fine, but the characters are so underdeveloped that its hard to care about whats happening. Every emotional beat feels forced, and instead of delivering a meaningful story, it comes off as preachy and artificial.And lets talk about the music-while an interesting concept, it doesnt add anything significant to the story. Instead, it disrupts the flow and makes the film feel even more disjointed.By the time the credits rolled, I was left wondering what exactly I had just watched. Its the kind of movie that tries so hard to be deep and artistic that it forgets to be entertaining or cohesive. A huge disappointment.",1,18,5,0.07777777777777777,0.5648989898989898

,Well Made Musical AND A Contender,"Practically a musical about a drug lord who wants to find herself AND moved forward. With a little help of a lowly public attorney, they navigate the changing world of the cartel AND maybe bring change after all.Wow this was shockingly better than expected.I do see why people would hate it. There is cringe in how some of the musical numbers were made. The infamous sex-change song, and the victims sing-along are cringe galore. I personally did not think the male-female dichotomy of the main character as condescending, but I could see why people would think that. It is used as an escape in this film, which can be seen as dense.Also, other than the aforementioned two numbers, the musical in this is shockingly well made. I think its nice it was not entirely concerned in making it sing forward, but rather performance forward. It makes it such a nice departure to classical musical AND makes it seamless. A lot of modern musicals is often trapped in that guise AND while some tries this approach, film like Les Misérables, is trapped with the Singing-Out-Loud aesthetic of its mother musical. It felt dynamic without feeling so rigid.Performance wise, the trio of Zaldana, Gascon and Gomez a really deserves the accolades, especially the former two. They were both marvelous in the film AND felt like they really bring their A Game. They both went for it with their performance.The script definitely is interesting.I do not agree that the scripting is awkward though. I think people in film should be rambunctious in how they describe desire AND all the things they feel. It should not be looked down lol. Audacity is often looked down by a lot of young viewers AND I think that is one element that filmmaking in general has lost. People think having sex, doing drugs and cussing makes a film audacious, but I think making it quotable is by far more impactful.It can be criticized for its almost escapism and idealized Mexico BUT still very well developed.On Emilias gender, I personally do not understand the idea that this film is writing Emilia as a male-female hybrid personality. People does not realize that most transgender MTF are lesbians or bi/pan anyhow. In truth, its not far-fetched BUT also underseen in this kind of non-judgmental way sadly. She is women AND she does not need to explain it or is clocked for her past - which on its own is radical.Back on the film, it can be a bit typical with how it went, but I guess that is the charm of it. The story cannot be complicated with all the music already. Its about redemption AND there is so much elephant in the room - but it is definitely more focused on the melodrama of her and the family she had left behind. Ending especially is the film going Hayes coded with it BUT I do not see how it can be otherwise.I really liked it more than what I initially taught. This is a great film I can see why people will hate it BUT I think there is an important credence to this film that is often overlooked. Lovely but the much-criticized parts are really rough.

Though maybe Im just biased as a Rare Beauty fan whos also seen her Disney days. However, even she cannot salvage this mess. The movie fails to represent Mexican culture or transsexuality in a genuine or respectful way, which is a major letdown considering theyre the main two themes. The songs are awful, too - they feel awkward and disjointed, almost as if they were clumsily translated without much thought to flow or meaning, and theyre downright unpleasant to listen to, so if I could skip them I would. The plot had some promise, but poor execution, shallow character development, and cultural inaccuracies make the entire experience fall apart.

,The worst movie I have ever seen in my life,"Director Jacques Audiard claims that cinema does not pose answers, it poses questions. This statement seems to be a sophist attempt to divert attention from the shortcomings of his work and take the discussion to the level of rhetoric. However, the truth is that, in his own words, he did not even bother to investigate the subject that the film addresses.The result is a Manichean proposal that addresses a delicate subject for Mexico. A foreigner decides to talk about a complex problem without the intention or the minimum interest in investigating its causes and consequences, much less showing empathy for the victims of organized crime or for the trans community that he claims to defend with his actress, Karla Sofía Gazcón, who proclaims herself the best existing actress .The film falls into the false dichotomy of transphobia: if you did not like the film, you are a prejudiced ignoramus and it is obvious that it is part of his campaign.Cinema does not pose answers, it poses questions. The question is: What is being awarded? Or better yet, why did this man decide to make this new version of the emperors new clothes that has united a nation in repudiation? Or an even better question: why not make something of quality? There are films like Sicario or El Infierno that address the subject more profoundly, raising questions with quality work. Maybe because it would have required doing prior research, something Audiard refused to do and limited himself to filling the boxes that would guarantee him an award.Emilia Pérez is a film that has generated great controversy in Mexico. Its research, empathy, and cinematic quality deficiencies are evident. The film seems to attempt to take advantage of a sensitive subject to win awards and recognition with a broad campaign of cinemas and experts supporting the film to spoon-feed us this rubbish.",1,13,3,0.14668456543456543,0.4505556943056943

Its the depictions of being morally bankrupt and yet being oblivious to the fact, is what I found cringey and unacceptable. These characters are used to propagate a plot around a kingpin who wants to make amends and resorts to self body mutilation to escape justice. While other characters are either facilitating or opposing this procedure, with Manitas kids becoming collateral damage.Manitas is just a weird caricature of a human being who seems to reflect the deviance that people resort to when they are mentally disturbed or running from the law while, using the pretext of Starting over a new life, to make questionable decisions that impact others as well.I didnt find this movie remotely entertaining and was aghast when I heard, this was nominated for Oscars.I wouldnt recommend watching this movie.",1,13,3,-0.07924242424242424,0.507895622895623

I immediately went and recommended to everyone I know after watching. The film really is an expression of self love. Emilia has never loved herself, and her past shows the hatred that was once in her heart. After Emilias transition, the film blossoms as does Emilias love. However, that does not erase her past, which takes the film from drama to an action real quick in the last half of the film. Selena Gomezs, Jessi, is the representation of this and how to go forward sometimes you cant erase, but instead love as Emilia finally does, which ends the film beautifully.

Pathetic.Atrocious pacing, mediocre dialogue, plot hole galore.. Laughable, trite lyricism that falls painfully flat at its attempt at earnestness... bizarre dance sequences...

Karla Sofia Gascóns acting was also pretty good the majority of the time when she wasnt singing. The rest is straight up Ill illaudable trash.

Both Audiard and Von Trier are amazing, original, inspired directors, not many could pull out this type of movie. I can see here that a lot of Mexicans did not like it as it does not represent their country well. But in my view, the fact that the movie takes place mostly in Mexico is secondary. The story and how its presented matters a lot more. The main character could be from the Italian mafia, or a French gangster. It hardly matters. Its hard to describe such a piece, and the best is to watch it and decide. It will not please everyone.",9,3,30,0.2533333333333333,0.5366666666666667
,Straight up mockery of the Trans and Mexican community,"Emilia Perez attempts to tackle serious themes but fails due to its misguided execution. Karla Sofía Gascón, a white woman, plays a brown Mexican man in full brownface-an offensive and outdated practice that should have no place in modern cinema. The film also suffers from poor translations, like Bienvenido being incorrectly used as Youre welcome, showing a lack of cultural authenticity.Beyond that, the movie completely misrepresents what it means to be transgender. It frames transitioning as a rebirth that allows someone to erase their past, rather than as a journey of embracing ones true self. Being transgender is not about escaping history but about finally living authentically. This portrayal oversimplifies and distorts a deeply personal experience in a way that feels both ignorant and exploitative.Additionally, Emilia Perez leans on serious social issues to appear profound, but instead of handling them with nuance, it reduces them to surface-level drama. Important themes deserve respect, not sensationalism. A tone-deaf, offensive film that fails at what it set out to do.",1,8,1,-0.04659090909090908,0.4890151515151515
,Worst Musical ever,"Emilia Pérez is one of those movies that had so much potential on paper but completely crumbled in execution. Honestly, I went in expecting a bold narrative, blending music, identity, and a bit of grit, but what I got instead was a confusing mess that left me disappointed.First off, the cultural aspect. This movie is supposed to depict Mexican culture, but it feels so surface-level and drenched in stereotypes that I couldnt take it seriously. Its as if they were checking off a list of clichés rather than authentically exploring the richness of the culture. The decision to cast non-Mexican actors for key roles? Thats just another nail in the coffin. It feels like a missed opportunity to highlight genuine voices.Then theres the whole handling of transgender themes. Its not just clumsy-its borderline offensive. Instead of crafting a heartfelt story about identity and transformation, the movie turns it into a plot gimmick. It lacks the emotional depth or nuance that a subject like this deserves, and I found myself cringing at how one-dimensional the portrayal was. Its 2025-audiences expect better than this.Now, lets talk about the music, which shouldve been the backbone of a musical. Its forgettable. Thats the best word I can use. The songs feel more like plot explanations set to music rather than pieces that stand on their own. Nothing about the soundtrack stuck with me. A good musical makes you hum a tune on the way home-this one just made me want to hit the mute button.The direction and tone are all over the place. At times, it tries to be a dark comedy, then it shifts to heartfelt drama, and before you know it, youre watching a scene that feels like a parody. Its exhausting trying to figure out what the movie is even aiming for.Even the performances, which I thought would at least be a saving grace, were underwhelming. Selena Gomez was miscast, plain and simple. Her Spanish feels stiff, her character lacks conviction, and the performance overall just didnt work. Its like they cast her for her name rather than whether she was right for the role.All in all, Emilia Pérez is a frustrating experience. Its one of those films where you can see what it could have been, but everything about it-its portrayal of culture, its themes, its music, its direction-just falls flat. If anything, its a reminder that a big-name cast and an ambitious idea mean nothing without proper execution. For me, this was a definite miss.",1,8,1,0.04824332171893148,0.46595528455284557
,"2024's ""Crash""","Even discounting the questionable trans/Mexican culture depictions in this movie, Emilia Pérez is a crock of crap that I cannot believe has won several prestigious awards and industry praise. It doesnt work as a musical, as most of the music is remarkably terrible with some of the worst lyrics Ive heard, it wouldnt surprise me if they were partially written by ChatGPT. The AI assistance on Gascóns vocals is extremely noticeable, where every song she gets featured on turns into a muddy mess. Even Selena Gomezs singing performance sounded lazy and phoned in, despite her being an actual professional singer.It also misses the mark as a crime or a comedy film, as everything Emilia Pérez tries to do has been done infinitely better in your average telenovela, and most of the laughs it did get from me was at its expense. But even the so bad theyre good scenes are few and far between as most of the film consists of boring, by the books melodrama between characters I cant get invested in for the life of me.Unless youre a glutton for punishment I cant really recommend checking out this film, as even watching it to laugh at it is a soul sucking experience thats ultimately just a slog to sit through.",2,8,1,-0.11111111111111109,0.5237654320987652

,Glorifies painful and offensive stereotypes. It's a mockery for the families of the disappeared.,"I find it disgusting, it glorifies painful and offensive stereotypes, not only mexican, but also about trans women. It is a hurtful mockery for the families of the people disappeared by the drug war. Not every dreamy idea from a director imagination its art, specially when his vision shows so much ignorance and he doesnt take the time nor the interest to commit to the very theme he is trying to state and dismiss it as if it was a a choice like picking a topping for pizza. The songs are ridiculous, not in a funny way but offensive and shallow, seems like the caracters were drunk huevo cartoons . The dialogues are not even understandable for a spanish speaker, let alone speakers of other languages, and they make no sense .

,Disappointing and derogatory,"Given all of its awards and accolades, I was really looking forward to seeing this, but to say I was disappointed, is an understatement. It might have worked better as a straightforward film, but the bizarre decision to shoehorn surreal song and dance routines into an otherwise serious drama is, at best, cringeworthy and, at worst, ludicrous. I love alternative, quirky films, but this isnt even that. As its so badly executed, it winds up being pretentious drivel. One particular routine set in a gender affirmation facility is destined to go down in cinematic infamy.Once I got past the whole musical-drama crossover schtick, I gave it a chance even though it took me a good half hour before I actually became invested in the story, which is an interesting one for the most part; its just let down by some questionable creative choices, bad dialogue , and a finale that ends up being almost farcical. All credit to Zoë Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón for their performances as I cant fault them, but as an overall film, it just doesnt work.I checked online to make sure that I hadnt just missed something but no, my opinion seems to align with the majority. Even the communities it purports to portray - namely, trans women, and the victims of Mexican drug cartels - seem to hate it in equal measures. I get the distinct feeling the awards committees are very much patting themselves on the back for being inclusive, but it actually does a disservice to such communities - acting performances aside - to heap accolades on what is objectively, a bad film.How it won the Golden Globe and secured so many BAFTA nominations ahead of Wicked as being the better musical is actually quite baffling. Definitely a case of The Emperors New Clothes and until someone stands up and shouts, But hes naked!, I fear it will sweep the Oscars also.",4,8,1,0.028685816498316502,0.45568497474747477

Instead of delivering a compelling narrative, it leans too heavily on its own self-importance. At times, watching it felt unbearably cringe, especially listening to the accents and singing.

When the director blatantly disregards the importance of immersing themselves in Mexican culture, claiming its unnecessary to make a culturally authentic film, and the casting director follows up with a condescending assertion that there arent enough talented Mexican actors to do the roles justice, it says more about the productions arrogance and lack of respect than any review ever could. These statements betray a disregard for the very foundation of storytelling: understanding and honoring the perspectives youre trying to represent. A film is not just its cinematography, plot, or performances; its also the intention and care behind its creation. And when those intentions are rooted in ignorance and elitism, the final product is tainted before it even reaches the audience. I dont need to watch something that was built on such a shaky and disrespectful foundation to know its likely to be hollow, out of touch, and undeserving of my time.",1,12,3,0.01111111111111111,0.5400000000000001

,Ostentatious Basura,"This is what critics are losing their minds over? Emilia Perez isnt just a missed opportunity-its a cinematic sinkhole that was never good and never going to be good. Its lowbrow melodrama dressed up in designer clothes, pretending its the height of sophistication. It mightve even been campy if we had more of Selenas mangled Spanish and Zoe Saldanas over the top musical numbers. Id love to see any of these songs recreated at the Oscars, especially the provocative trans surgery song.Sure, the movie looks great-gorgeous camera work, and the musical numbers are so tightly choreographed youd think they were trying to distract you from the plot . But once the glitter fades, youre left with a mess. The trans representation and human trafficking commentary are so carelessly handled it feels like the writers Googled both topics for a couple minutes and called it a day. Honestly, it might offend drug cartels and the trans community equally, which is kinda an achievement in itself.Is Emilia Perez fun to look at? Absolutely!

,Emilia Perez: A superficial look at Mexico,"Emilia Perez, the latest film by French director Jacques Audiard, is an ambitious work that mixes elements of musical comedy, family drama and crime. However, the film fails to present a superficial and stereotypical view of Mexico, with caricatured characters and situations that border on the absurd.The plot revolves around Rita, a Mexican trans woman who decides to change her life and becomes a powerful head of a cartel. The premise is interesting, but the film does not delve into the complex issues involving gender identity and violence in Mexico. Instead, it opts for easy humor and worn-out stereotypes about Mexican culture.The performances are exaggerated and caricatured, with characters that seem to have come out of a cartoon. The soundtrack is full of clichés of Mexican music, such as mariachis and guitars. The photography is vibrant and colorful, but fails to capture the essence of the country.In short, Emilia Perez is a disappointing film that fails to go beyond stereotypes about Mexico. It is a superficial and caricatured work that does not contribute to the discussion of important issues such as gender identity and violence.",1,19,7,-0.007999999999999998,0.4626666666666667

In some scenes we see as if shes still someone that evokes fear especially the scene in London. But how did she get there and why? It just all seems so unbelievable.

Emilia Perez is not the Best Picture contender I had hoped for nor is does it live up to the expectations set by so many who loved it. Its a film so eager to be so many things, executed with incredible confidence. However, it most certainly bites off more than it can chew. As a trans story, as a musical, and as an ode to the missing in Mexico, it only partially delivers on each which is unfortunate. But its easy to admire and enjoyable to watch as the bold swing it is. Its just far too messy of a film, its juggling too much to find success.

,This may turn out to be a classic.,"Musicals come in all shapes and sizes. This year alone weve already had Joker: Folie a Deux which certainly broke new ground in the way in which it incorporated its musical numbers into its dark narrative but Joker: Folie a Deux feels almost commonplace when set beside Jacques Audiards extraordinary Emilia Perez, the tale of a Mexican drug-lords transition from male to female with the musical numbers so seamlessly woven into the narrative it often feels like an opera with swathes of dialogue sung by its large cast; it really is quite unlike anything else out there.Its been described as a womens picture in that it is dominated by its mostly female cast, with all four leading actresses taking the Best Actress prize at Cannes, namely the incredible trans actress Karla Sofia Gascon who plays both the male drug-lord Manitas and Emilia, the woman he becomes, Zoe Saldana, the lawyer who helps Emilia on her journey, Selena Gomez as Jessi, Manitas wife and Adriana Paz as the woman who becomes Emilias lover.Indeed this is a work of real brilliance and imagination; if it does have a failing perhaps it lies in its score, , which doesnt always come off and the treatment, however bold and remarkable, is unlikely to appeal to a mass audience.

,Misguided awards bait.,"I dont like that I dont like Emilia Pérez . Perhaps more accurately, I dont like that its not a good movie. I really want stuff like this to work, to prove to people that diverse stories are worth telling and can be both entertaining to the masses and important to the communities they represent. I also really hate the fact that me not liking this picture gives me something, however small and arbitrary, in common with the bigots who dislike it for the wrong reasons. I need to be clear: I love that this is a story about a trans woman, starring women in the major roles, that focuses on Mexican culture. I even like the concept of it being a musical. What I dont like is the fact that it takes a lazy approach to its representation that most Mexican and trans people seem to actively dislike, and that its perhaps the worst musical Ive ever seen. Its presentation is bland, its choreography is stilted, its cinematography is muddy, its writing is clumsy, and its singing is mostly monotone. If you saw any given scene, youd think this was some sort of parody. It isnt, though; its entirely sincere and it thinks its doing something really brave and important. The tone is all wrong for this type of story, and the feature feels as though its trapped by its serious crime-drama/ issues movie aesthetic when its concept clearly calls for something a lot more camp, colourful and celebratory. If youre going to do something like this, why not make it fun? Why not lean into the ridiculousness of the presentation, not to undermine its supposed theming but to reframe it as a joyous thing rather than a typically traumatic one. The only things it really has going for it are its performances, which are typically strong . Singing notwithstanding, Zoë Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón manage to chisel some relatively emotive moments out of the fairly rough raw material theyre given. Its nice to see the former in a role that doesnt require her to be painted green or animated blue, and Id like to see the latter in more movies, for sure.To be fair, there are some sequences and ideas that work relatively well, although almost none of them are musical. I cant lie and say that the vaginoplasty song hasnt replayed in my mind multiple times since the film finished, but I also cant claim that my retroactive enjoyment of it is anything more than ironic. If its musical aspects were better, the flick would be ten times more effective and its other issues would be easier to overlook. If it didnt take itself so dreadfully seriously, we wouldnt have to either. A pulpy picture should at least have the decency to know what it is, not pretend that its important and highbrow without earning either of those descriptors. Its problems would be much easier to see past if the affair they wasnt so clearly yearning for praise for simply including representation rather than actually getting it right. Dont get me wrong, representation is important even in its most basic version, but a lot of this is misguided at best and actively poor at worst. First, its worth mentioning that this is technically a French movie, co-written and directed by Jacques Audiard. Audiard doesnt speak a word of Spanish, and he has stated that he didnt feel it was necessary to do any research whatsoever on Mexico. The result is a picture that uses Mexico and Mexican people as an aesthetic, a container to wrap its narrative in rather than an integral part of its identity. It gets basic things about Mexico wrong, including using Castellano instead of Mexican Spanish , and it also trades in tired stereotypes. Its been criticized for not only focusing on the Cartel and continuing to push cinemas continued correlation of Mexico and gang violence, but also disrespecting victims of Cartel violence by using them solely as a method of redemption for its eponymous character . Furthermore, it seems to do all this simply to garner praise from the awards ceremonies its almost exclusively created for, feeling as though it uses diversity as a currency rather than something it deems truly important. Perhaps that wasnt the intention, but its the result. Whats worse is that the only actor who is actually from Mexico, Adriana Paz, isnt even getting any marketing or awards buzz, and it isnt because her performance is less successful than the others. She hasnt been nominated for anything, didnt sit with her castmates at the Golden Globes and didnt walk the red carpet. Its just odd for the film to celebrate its Hispanic roots without celebrating the one person actually from the specific region it focuses around. Dont get me wrong, its great to see a movie led by Hispanic people , and awards attention for non-white actors is always welcome. Its just that it definitely could do better, and we should call it out for that rather than simply celebrate it for doing the bare minimum. The flick was shot mostly in Paris and is a French production, so the financial benefits of its success are mostly going to a country that isnt represented within it. Its Frances submission for Best International Feature at the Oscars, so it would be Frances win, not Mexicos. Of course, as a white man, I cant speak for the cultures this represents, but Ive seen many people from those cultures feeling disenfranchised with this and can definitely understand why.While I love to see a movie that heavily features trans characters and actors, Im sad to report that GLAAD called this a retrograde portrayal of a trans woman. It gets basic things about the trans experience wrong, while also focusing on stereotyped aspects of said experience that arent particularly useful . It deadnames and misgenders its protagonist at key points and has several other overtly dodgy moments. It makes the mistake of portraying its eponymous character as an icon rather than a person, absolving her of her pre-transition violence because it seems to think shes inherently good simply because shes trans . The filmmakers have put forwards Gascón as leading actor in their bids for awards-season glory, but shes second billed in the film and its highly arguable her character isnt the protagonist . She gets less screen time than Saldaña, as the picture is yet another outing that uses a cis character as a surrogate for the audience. The choice to push her for lead actor is seemingly so the piece can get brownie points for enabling the first trans person to be nominated for a leading actor BAFTA, for instance. In theory, this is great; after all, its always a bonus when a trans actor is nominated for an award. Wouldnt it be greater if they were actually the leading actor in the film they were nominated for? Or if that film actually represented the trans community in a nuanced, respectful and powerful way? Its a minor point that Im hesitant to bring up, but it just feels like the filmmakers want to get awards for their own egos rather than to bring attention to communities often overlooked by awards bodies and audiences in general. Again, I have no problem with Gascón being nominated - in fact, its undeniably fantastic that she has been - but its worth holding the feature accountable . As a cis man, I cant claim to understand how all this plays to a trans person, nor dictate how they should feel about it, but I have sadly seen many reactions from trans film critics and Letterboxd members expressing disappointment with the affair. If you want a better write-up of why this misses the mark in terms of trans representation, I implore you to read their work.Look, theres clearly some passion here even if its difficult to see in the final result. Surely the filmmakers have good intentions, right? Im more cynical when it comes to the people behind the camera than those in front of it . The actors clearly care about project and want to do some good with it . As I mentioned earlier, its tricky because representation is almost always worthwhile to a degree , but a movie isnt immune to criticism simply because it attempts to represent a minority group. We should still demand better from our media, acknowledging the benefits of its limited understanding but exploring the areas in which it falls short so we can understand how to get things right in the future. This project is definitely misguided and needs to be called out it. I genuinely wish it was a masterpiece, because its about time there was some mainstream attention given to something good that actually reflects the trans experience and/or is immersed in Hispanic culture. Sadly, its a misfire. The more I read about the lazy, almost flippant approach taken to its writing and direction, and the more I read disheartened reactions written by Mexican and trans people, the less I like this feature. It has some merits, and its definitely interesting in theory, but it could have been so much better than it is. At the very least, it could have been entertaining. Sadly, though its never outright boring, it isnt exactly all that enjoyable. Its a shame, too.

,How not to write in one neat movie,"Emilia Perez should be shown in film classes for how *not* to write a screenplay. Characters appear and disappear. Selena Gomezs character just pops in and out until being crucial for the ending. Gustavo, another key character for the ending, says his first line, Callate o te chingo aqui mismo, cabrona four minutes until the credits roll.Its unclear how and why some characters relate to each other until Rita just outright says it in an exposition parade with Epifania. But what she says is a total surprise because the previous scenes do nothing to build to it.Some of the songs are decent - El Mal for example. Some are downright disgraceful, like the one that mentions vaginoplasty.Ultimately, theres no character development. You never really know what motivates any of the characters in the movie apart from maybe Jessi, but even that doesnt make too much sense. And this doesnt say very much about the obvious fact that none of the writers have ever spent any meaningful time in Mexico or had any meaningful conversation with someone from there.The fact that this movie got 13 Oscar nominations and won however many Golden Globes is a disgrace. Some of the acting is decent , but good acting with bad material shouldnt necessarily win awards.",4,4,0,0.1261594202898551,0.439927536231884
,"Brilliant, not everyone will get it..","I think all of the bad reviews are missing the point. This film is an artistic gem, and entirely unique. Its not quite a musical in my opinion but a blend of live theatre, and spoken word. People reference the bad lyrics, but it feels more like singing to the pauses for word choice effects. It is about what is being said context-wise, since the words are about the lack of justice, not just as a sing and dance number. Saldanas character is complex, she is a lawyer in a pocket of Mexico where the cartel is interwoven into every corner of the city, and she begins by saying she knows that she works for wolves. She knows its her work and words that the male delivering them, will win the case, even if its unjust. The whole thing begins with that tiredness of living in a city where everywhere you step- you are part of the injustice. This is not something people who see Mexico as just a vacation beach country will understand or get about its nuanced politics. There is a history of violence, of college kids going missing, of it almost feeling that the crime is commonplace. I disagree that it glamorises the cartel, I didnt get that from the tone. Manitas at the very beginning states he is tired of all of it, but doesnt deem it fair that he die to escape it all. The themes here are about what is fair, and whether the characters can really escape the things they want to get away from by changing identities, moving countries. Etc. It is clear that there is a seeping through the new life, the undercurrents of the old. I think if people take this as a representation of trans life, its not fair to the fact that one film character cannot capture an entire groups reality. There are concepts that transcend across all- which from the film were the difficulty of trying to hang on to loved ones from the old life while not jeopardising the new identity. I disagree that this film is just about trying to shed an old guilt. That comes in later to the plot line and is not an immediate motivating factor for Emilias character.The feel of it is effortlessly flowing between spoken word, dance, and a live theatre feel. While still taking on pretty raw realities about cartel violence in those regions of Mexico where justice is a murky thing to make out. Particularly because someway or another, someone has ties to the cartel, either through money, or connections.I think this film is not something people who havent been aware of Mexicos issues with cartel violence will be able to get much from. Its not a film that is meant to give you all the answers, its more in the vein of Megalopolis, or less straight-forward cinema. I watched Dune and loved that too- but this creativity and how it dealt with so many threads in a seamless manner is a well deserved win categorically.I encourage those who like to think through the parallels and ironies of a situation and character to watch this film. It is one that I wont forget, and has me considering the challenges of justice, community, crime, and identities in a new way.",10,3,43,0.1549852924852925,0.4557581307581307
,It shouldn't have been a musical in the first place!,"Although my generally less favourable point of view towards musicals made me dislike its fantastical, almost dreamlike setup, I did find the story of a hardened mans persistent wish to embrace his inherent identity, his struggle of liberation from his past, from his own self, to be quite effective.Specifically in spaces where our lead, Emilia Perez, played sincerely by Karla Sofia Gascón, by the way, has to shoulder the responsibility.Suffice it to say, she did well and elevated the artistry in those scenes to a certain degree.For the rest, I dont have anything significant to add; I wish they focused more on Emilia than Jessica or even Rita .That could have made me appreciate the main story little bit more I guess.",4,10,3,0.2251785714285714,0.5096428571428572
,Genre-bending or just inconsistent?,"There is nothing inherently wrong with making a musical out of an untraditional subject. Its been done successfully before, and artists should not have to make exceptions to their vision to pander to a single target audience. That being said, making a musical out of a film that seemingly doesnt need it can be looked at as an attempt to cover up a world of hurt. I believe that to be the case here.Despite a brilliant concept, this picture tries and fails to incorporate song and dance to disguise a poorly conceived, skin deep script. If this is truly an attempt to tell a thought provoking trans story in a unique way, it undermines that goal when every other scene squeezes in campy tone shifts like voguing nurses or charity gala rap battles. Also, while trans story this certainly is, I would far from consider the titular protagonist a positive trans figure. Even if one ignores her past as a drug cartel kingpin , she also abandons her family and then later tries to secretly reinsert herself under a new identity and steal back her kids... That should never be viewed through an empathetic lens.Gender dysphoria is a serious topic, but Emilia is not a good character to address it through. With all other characters being awful, as well, there is no one to root for in this story, despite the script desperately wanting you to. One also needs to point out the suspension of disbelief required to convince the viewer that NO ONE is able to identify Emilia in 4 years, even after she reenters the public eye. Also, a prepubescent child singing an aria about his late fathers scent heavily takes viewers out of what little immersion has been built up by this point.However, those are perhaps the least of this movies problems. Ultimately, this is the type of film that open minded folks feel like they need to support and give awards to, but its simply not a good movie. It may have made for 3 or 4 good movies if the concepts were given time to breathe separately. Instead, the filmmakers smooshed them all together into messy Oscar-bate.",3,10,3,-0.06553862803862803,0.5109584859584859
,Divisive for a reason,"Well, I can see why this one is so divisive. I would compare it to one of those amusement park ships swinging back and forth. Interesting ideas...matched with a cartoonish portrayal of Mexican society. Intriguing twists...paired with giant plot holes. Innovative opera homages...along with downright laughable songs. The ship lurched back and forth violently until I got sick to my stomach. It is definitely original, but it is also really flawed. Plus, Im just not sure who it is for. Fans of musicals would want better music. People who love Mexican stories will want a more true portrayal of their home. Regardless, it definitely found at least one audience: awards voters. And awards are subjective like everything else, so people can vote for what they like. Still, Villeneuve getting passed over for Audiard will probably not age well.",4,10,3,0.023035714285714277,0.5523015873015873
,A Symphony of Identity: Emilia Perez and the Uneasy Marriage of Musical Theater and Crime Drama,"Jacques Audiards Emilia Perez unfolds like a fever dream at the crossroads of two seemingly incompatible cinematic traditions. On one side, the gritty, blood-soaked terrain of cartel violence; on the other, the soaring, larger-than-life world of musical theater. Its an audacious creative gamble-a director known for his bruising realism stepping onto the precarious tightrope of genre fusion. The result is a film that sings in moments but often staggers under the weight of its own ambition, leaving the viewer to wonder if the musical form truly elevates the story it seeks to tell or merely embellishes it with spectacle.The narrative is one of transformation and self-assertion. Emilia , once Emilio, is a feared lawyer for a Mexican drug cartel who decides, after years of repression, to transition and escape the shadow of her violent past. Audiard uses music as an emotional gateway into this journey, allowing Emilias deepest fears, desires, and triumphs to pour out through song. In theory, its a fitting choice: musicals thrive on characters expressing what words alone cannot contain. Yet, in execution, the film stumbles over its own tonal contradictions, raising questions about whether the heightened theatricality serves Emilias story or distracts from its emotional weight.The films opening sequence is a declaration of intent. In an underworld hideout shrouded in shadow and menace, Emilia-still living as Emilio-bursts into a song of longing and entrapment. The contrast is jarring: the brutality of the cartels world collides with the vulnerability of a voice cutting through the darkness. Its a bold statement, signaling that this is not a story confined to the grim realism of genre convention. Yet the dissonance between the two modes-cinema vérité grit and Broadway bravado-feels less like harmony and more like a collision. The film struggles to reconcile these parallel languages, leaving the viewer unmoored.Much of this tension lies in the construction of the musical pieces themselves. Scored by Alexandre Desplat, with contributions from Latin American composers and lyricists, the songs range from intimate ballads to bombastic ensemble numbers, drawing on mariachi-inspired rhythms, pop-infused melodies, and Broadway-style crescendos. On their own, several of these pieces are memorable, even stirring. A standout is Emilias solo, performed in front of a mirror as she takes the first steps toward embracing her identity-her voice a mixture of defiance and trembling vulnerability. In that moment, the music feels like an extension of her soul, a raw and direct connection to her inner life.However, these moments of synergy are undercut by a broader inconsistency in how the musical elements are integrated into the narrative. Too often, the songs feel like interruptions rather than continuations of the story. A nightclub duet between Emilia and María , for instance, is visually dazzling but narratively hollow, doing little to propel the plot or deepen the characters relationships. Similarly, some of the ensemble numbers, while choreographically ambitious, feel disconnected from the personal stakes of Emilias journey, as though they were designed more for their visual impact than their emotional resonance.This unevenness extends to the performances. Gascón is the films magnetic center, her voice carrying the weight of years of repression and the exhilaration of self-discovery. She moves seamlessly between the rawness of Emilias struggles and the heightened theatricality of the musical form, grounding even the films most flamboyant sequences in emotional authenticity. In contrast, her co-stars struggle to find the same balance. Selena Gomez, as pop star María, brings charisma to the screen but lacks the vocal range and narrative depth to fully inhabit her musical moments. Zoe Saldaña, as Ana-an initially skeptical lawyer who becomes Emilias confidante-delivers a nuanced dramatic performance, but her role in the musical numbers feels restrained, as though she is holding back from fully embracing the films theatricality.A deeper issue lies in the films structure. Musicals traditionally use songs to deepen character arcs and drive the narrative forward, but in Emilia Perez, the musical numbers often feel superimposed onto the story rather than emerging organically from it. This lack of cohesion is particularly apparent in the films middle section, where the pacing becomes sluggish, weighed down by songs that linger too long without advancing the plot. Audiards direction seems caught between his instinct for naturalistic storytelling and his desire to embrace the heightened reality of the musical form, resulting in a film that feels neither fully immersive nor entirely grounded.Visually, Emilia Perez amplifies the theatricality of its musical sequences with bold, saturated colors and dynamic camera movements, courtesy of cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine. These scenes pulse with energy, drawing on the vibrant aesthetics of Latin American culture and blending them with the visual language of classic Hollywood musicals. Yet, this visual exuberance often clashes with the muted, shadowy palette of the films non-musical scenes, creating a stylistic inconsistency that mirrors the tonal dissonance of the narrative.Despite its flaws, Emilia Perez does achieve moments of genuine poignancy, particularly in its exploration of Emilias transition. The films use of music to externalize her inner turmoil and triumphs offers a level of emotional immediacy that dialogue alone could not achieve. At its best, the musical form becomes a vehicle for self-expression, mirroring Emilias journey to break free from societal constraints and claim her identity on her own terms.Yet, these moments of brilliance only highlight the films missed opportunities. The musical form has the potential to elevate the story, to take the audience deeper into Emilias emotional world, but *Emilia Perez* stops short of fully realizing this potential. Instead, it often feels as though the music is working in parallel to the narrative rather than in concert with it, resulting in a film that is compelling in parts but frustratingly uneven as a whole.What lingers after the credits roll is less a cohesive story than a series of impressions: the raw power of Gascóns performance, the surreal beauty of certain musical sequences, the films willingness to take risks even when those risks dont always pay off. Emilia Perez is a film that defies easy categorization, a bold experiment that refuses to conform to the expectations of either the crime drama or the musical. Its flaws are undeniable, but they are the kind of flaws that come from reaching for something beyond the ordinary.For all its imperfections, Emilia Perez carves out a space for itself in the cinematic landscape, offering a vision that is as messy and contradictory as the act of transformation itself. Its a film that asks its audience to embrace its inconsistencies, to see beauty in its cacophony. Whether one views it as a flawed masterpiece or a misstep with flashes of brilliance, it is a work that insists on being grappled with, a testament to the power of cinema to push boundaries and reimagine what stories-and genres-can be.",8,2,24,0.06101358363858363,0.4014172771672772
,the worst movie,"I just sat through *Emilia Pérez*, and I cannot believe I wasted my time on this absolute train wreck of a film. Not only is it one of the most baffling, misguided, and painfully dull movies Ive seen in years, but the fact that it somehow landed **thirteen** Oscar nominations is proof that Hollywood is completely out of touch with reality. How does a movie this terrible manage to fool critics and Academy voters? Lets break down the many reasons why this film is an insult to cinema.1. The Story is a MessFirst and foremost, *Emilia Pérez* doesnt seem to know what the hell it wants to be. Is it a musical? A crime thriller? A social commentary? A soap opera? Who knows! It tries to juggle so many tones and themes that it ends up failing at all of them. The script is a disaster, packed with clumsy dialogue, forced melodrama, and an utterly ridiculous premise that demands way more suspension of disbelief than it deserves.Instead of crafting a compelling narrative, the film goes off on random tangents, with bizarre character decisions, unnecessary subplots, and half-baked ideas that never pay off. I spent half the movie wondering, Why am I supposed to care about any of this? and the other half questioning if the filmmakers even knew what they were trying to say.2. The Performances are OverhypedOne of the main reasons *Emilia Pérez* has been making waves is the cast, but lets be real-theres nothing Oscar-worthy happening here. Every single performance is either overacted to the point of absurdity or so underwhelming that it barely registers. The lead actress, despite all the praise, delivers an exaggerated, almost caricature-like performance that makes it impossible to take the character seriously.And can we talk about the supporting cast? Some of the performances are so wooden that I thought I was watching a bad high school play. Others are trying so hard to be emotional and powerful that it turns into parody. There is no middle ground-everyone is either over-the-top or completely lifeless. Not exactly the ingredients for Oscar gold.3. The Musical Numbers Are AwfulWho the hell thought this film needed to be a musical? Because let me tell you, it did NOT. The songs are forgettable, the choreography is lifeless, and every time the movie decides to break into a musical number, it kills whatever little momentum the story had. Its as if the filmmakers thought throwing in random singing would automatically make the film feel artistic. Spoiler alert: it doesnt.Instead, it feels like a gimmick-one that drags out an already excruciating runtime. The songs are forced, awkward, and add absolutely nothing to the narrative. If anything, they make the film feel even more disjointed. This isnt *La La Land*, and it sure as hell isnt *Chicago*. Its just a misguided attempt at blending genres that dont mix.4. The Pacing is Painfully SlowIf youre hoping for a fast-paced, engaging story, *Emilia Pérez* will bore you to death. This movie **drags**. Scenes go on forever, characters ramble endlessly, and the entire film feels about an hour longer than it needs to be. Theres no sense of urgency, no compelling tension-just a lot of pointless filler stretched out to an unbearable degree.By the time the third act rolls around, youre exhausted from sitting through so much nothing. And then, instead of delivering a satisfying conclusion, the movie decides to wrap up with the most pretentious, self-important ending possible, as if it actually accomplished something. Newsflash: it didnt.5/. 13 Oscar Nominations??? Are You Kidding Me?Heres the part that really pisses me off. This garbage got **thirteen** Oscar nominations. **THIRTEEN.** Thats more than some of the greatest films in history. How? HOW? Was the Academy high when they voted? Did they even watch the same film I did? Because there is absolutely no way this disaster deserves to be in the same conversation as genuinely great cinema.Best Picture? What a joke. Best Actress? For what-overacting in every single scene? Best Original Score? The music was laughably bad! Its as if the Academy just threw nominations at it because they were afraid of looking uncultured if they didnt praise it. This isnt groundbreaking, its not deep, its not even good-its just a mess that somehow convinced people its important.# Final Verdict: A Pretentious, Overhyped, Overrated Mess*Emilia Pérez* is the kind of movie that mistakes being different for being good. It tries way too hard to be edgy and artistic but ends up being a convoluted, insufferable disaster that collapses under its own ambition. The writing is terrible, the pacing is unbearable, the performances are overrated, and the musical elements are completely unnecessary. The fact that this disasterpiece is now an Oscar darling just proves how out-of-touch Hollywood has become.If you want to watch a movie that actually deserves award recognition, skip this pretentious nonsense and find something with actual depth, heart, and craftsmanship. Because *Emilia Pérez*? Its not cinema-its a joke.Final Score: 1/10 .",1,8,2,-0.002877365689865678,0.5154937423687422

,The usual netflix garbage. Why expect anything else?,"For me as with many over the last few years Netflix has seen a precipitous decline in quality from the highs it started out at a decade ago. This movie is a great example of that.I normally like Luca Guadagninos storytelling, he has a whimsical, interesting approach that tackles difficult subjects like sexuality. Im honestly not sure why he wanted to make a musical but this is probably his worst film yet.I speak spanish and the accents are distracting. Its obvious the translation was done by a machine as the phrasing is just weird, awkward, and clunky. It feels like hollywoods chat-gpt influenced idea of what Mexico and Mexican Spanish are rather than something authentic. And given that LA is about 6 hours away from actual Mexico which has a plethora of actors from telenovelas as well as a strong domestic film scene just makes it feel very cheap and dumb that the creators of the film didnt spring for something... realistic?Not to mention the plot itself is just bizarre and weird, and seems almost intentionally chosen to the point it veers on ragebait. Like this obviously heinous individual, who was an assassin and apparently responsible for countless murders, is given a second chance after becoming trans? It sounds like a fantasy straight from the mouth of our president. Theres room to be interesting here but the very weird musical elements and clunky dialogue only detract from what was a very silly plot.There were a lot of different directions this couldve taken that I think wouldve been better but the film just seems to be allergic to nuance.

,Could be one of the worst movies ever.,"Emelia Perez is a melodramatic disaster that somehow managed to secure a spot in the limelight. Imagine a film where a Mexican drug lord decides to transition into a woman, but instead of exploring this with any depth or nuance, it turns into a cringe-worthy musical. Yes, you heard that right-a musical about a transgender cartel boss. The plot is as ridiculous as it sounds, with the story careening from one absurd scenario to another without any regard for coherence or cultural sensitivity. The characters are about as deep as a kiddie pool, and the music? Lets just say its like listening to a cat in a blender. The film seems to think its groundbreaking, but its just a lazy, over-the-top caricature of Mexico and its issues, wrapped in a veneer of faux-progressiveness.

,"Fake, insincere film","Watching this film brings an immense feeling of insincerity on so many levels. It felt as if someone was trying to jump on the bandwagon and be current and relevant while not having any sincere thoughts or feelings towards the subject, the culture and, whats worse - cannot hide his disgust and cluelessness about the topic he is trying to claim his own in a pathetic attempt to stay current. The author made a film only masquerading as progressive, while in reality, its utterly regressive and fake. Pretending to be progressive, the director Audiard cant escape showing - by mistake- what he really feels. In their very first scene together, Rita literally gasps with disgust at Emilia opening her shirt to prove shes serious about transitioning. Her reaction shot alone is being played like a body horror reveal is enough. Also, the character of Manitas, while still being a male, is a horrible, insensitive, cruel, ruthless human being. And when that same character changed sex, the character is magically full of empathy, kindness, and helpfulness. Shallow and simplistic and, again, fake and insincere. Not to mention the horrible Spanish language and the phony accents. The French writer/director didnt even bother to research Mexico, and he was pretty cavalier about. He said, I didnt study Mexico much. What I needed to know I already knew a little bit.",2,7,1,-0.13811274509803922,0.5943627450980392

,A confused mess,"Much like the Mexican cartel boss and his/her/their confused identity, the movie cant quite figure out what it wants to be either.Granting it the status of a musical in the same year that saw the release of Wicked is like calling The Shining a dramedy. Neither is it a rock opera , but with no memorable songs to sing along to, the movie is best when it sticks to the drama.And its a terrific concept: a tough-as-nails cartel boss that has always identified as a woman seeks a sex change and a new start in life. But while you can take the cartel boss out of the picture, you cant make the violent manipulator disappear quite as easily.That should have been enough to hang a movie on, but director Jacques Audiard has to auteur things up, flitting between genres, locales, lyrics and plot lines with the abandonment of a twink at a Bangkok sex change emporium where everything is on the menu .With so many issues, its no wonder Audiard opts to just blow it all up in a rather cartoonish way, rather than allow his characters to discover a way through the mess. After all, with a little harder work, our future shouldnt have to be defined by our past - nor would this movie have to be defined by its shortcomings.",5,6,1,-0.00700757575757576,0.3849747474747474

No matter what I might think of transgender inappropriately stealing women prices in sport and movies, this is a group of people that exist, even when they are highly manufactured and surgically done. Nevertheless their stories matters and shape society for good and bad. The problem with this movie is the lack of credibility of the story. Transgender woman dont usually are gangsters or murderers in their previous lives but the victims of what the underworld has to offer. They are outcast both before and after transitioning. Nor are they attracted to women both before and after the transition, specially not in cultures like the Mexican or Latino where most transgender dont like their sex because they are homosexuals and dont feel normal or socially approved because of that. Despite of this the movie is funny and entertaining with very compelling acting. Dont hate it for that, just enjoy the ride.",10,3,53,0.10251322751322754,0.5090476190476191
,Cultural appropriation without memorable songs,"Emilia Pérez feels like a European attempt to cater to a U. S. audience by borrowing heavily from Mexican culture but without a genuine understanding of it. The result is a film filled with cultural appropriation and stereotypical depictions of Mexico. While the musical format might make it stand out, the songs themselves are underwhelming and fail to elevate the experience. Without its musical element, Emilia Pérez would be completely forgettable.The lack of Spanish fluency in some of the cast only reinforces the sense of inauthenticity. Even the title, Emilia Pérez, seems like an attempt to sound exotic for European audiences, but it ultimately comes across as bland and unmemorable.",4,6,1,0.029629629629629634,0.4407407407407407

With the exception of the first musical scene, almost all of them are weak, mediocre or shameful, its hard to believe what appears on the screen, the musical scene of Zoe Saldanas character talking to the surgeon is one of the most pathetic things Ive ever seen in a film. In the end, Emilia Perez is a film that made me enter a state of mental morbidity, because its impressive how this thing got so much visibility. If the repercussions werent so great and some critics werent so exaggerated, who knows, Emilia Perez would be just another mediocre film. I even like some scenes in Emilia Perez, I think Zoe Saldana is very good in the film, but the brainwashing that this film offers is so great, that in the end youll consider Emilia Perez a kind of mental torture. In the end, even the good things this film has are suffocated by the overall low quality.

,Must Be In The Minority,"Unless I am over thinking this, only a biopic or true event films need to be factually correct. Infact Jacques Audiard pens and directs a more than decent story set loosely around the Mexican drug cartels.

You have to remind yourself, this is a criminal.Rita, a lawyer by trade, is given a once in a lifetime time opportunity to change the life of one of Mexicos biggest and most dangerous drug lords. Emila Perez welcomes their new life, but challenges are around the corner.Most contrary to many opnion here the cast is amazing including Selena Gomez and Zoe Saldana .

,Loud,"And now Im also going to be mad with the French Oscars committee for naming this instead of All We Imagine as Light.First things first. The obsession with everything that assaults our senses. With the loud. With the fast. With the chaos. Yesterday I saw Anora and today this, but its all a consequence of the chaotic world we live in, with everything and everyone shouting. People need to shout to be listened and we are all shouting all the time. Now even in movies.This film has style and strong performances. It also has ridiculous musical numbers that almost made me want to hide from the cringe. There are good scenes. But it also has inexplicable script choices. There are characters that are thrown in without context, lacking development, but that are there to - literally - carry the final flag.The fundraising dinner scene is a musical number that will stick in memory and is fantastic, but I cant help thinking about how this film fails utterly in what should be its emotional strengths, never delving deeply into anything because its always in a rush to add something more to an already oversaturated script. I have many doubts about several of the messages, but above all I felt that not even their writers know what they wanted to say.",5,21,12,0.05278925619834711,0.5371212121212122

For a reason I have denied it cause well dont know if ye already know my review of the narco culture n genre.Here the real review: Dont like anything of this topic, meaning the movie follows the same trope like any film of this genre, n to worsen ye add Selina Gomez really bad situation that doesnt make justice.The whole thing of drug lord wanting a sex change is the most dumb or idiotic, ye ve to understand Mexico culture always been of machismo entonces it was not convincing or relatable for making it awful.But doesnt mean the acting n music rule the most from already give her the Oscar Zoe Saldana awesome performance from start to Crackaboom finish she gives her voice from the musical scene Meaning shining in the ballroom, who wrote that song? Cause she killed it.Karla Sofia Gascon sold her performance, really good choice to play the virgen Mary of the film, her relationship with Rita was fun n agonizing for making her dirty work, but really give pride to the tranny community.The weakest was Selina Gomez felt spoil n flat that really it was so obvious where it was headed not even the musical couldnt save.So conclude really love the message it follows about the many disappearance that my nation has, not fond of the story but Saldana awesomeness sanging n acting she better have that Oscars.Narco n musical it just not right, but hey ye like a dynamite acting n awesome score Then watch it.",8,1,15,0.1191778273809524,0.4159040178571428

The drama sometimes plunges into tragedy only to resurface with a new perspective. At times, one feels quite embarrassed to be charmed by it. Finally, cinema that breaks away from Hollywood tradition. A film that loosens the long-held conservative rules of American cinema.

Speaking of representing Mexico, this film fails miserably in that regard-not to mention the terrible accent and expressions that would only make sense in French, as if everything had just been thrown into a translator.Another point Id like to highlight is that Selena Gomezs performance in this film is far from impressive. The truth is, critics dont care whether this movie is good or not; they only care about themes and ideologies, completely ignoring the fact that this film fails to represent anyone or anything it tries to.",3,8,2,-0.14780701754385966,0.6434210526315789

What is it that makes it so strikingly different?Well, the title character is definitely unique - a big bad cartel boss who is secretly a trans woman. Sounds like a gag. But it isnt. She is a flesh and blood human being who just happened to have this unusual life story. I am not into identity politics. In fact, I very much dislike them. I was entranced by Emilia Perez not because shes trans, but because shes human. And I dont think it worked this well just because Carla Sofia Gascon is a trans woman herself. I think it worked because she has this screen presence that is just so - human.Theres more. Its a musical. Sounds like another gag. But its not. The musical numbers are essential. They gave the movie depth, supercharged the emotional punches, while weaving seamlessly through the flow.And about that flow - theres a reason this film is being noticed for its editing.

,Very bad! All those awards are a shame!,"I dont know what is going on... it seems a bad joke. How an awful movie like this may be so much awarded everywhere, including 13 nominations in the Academy Awards, the Jury Prize in Cannes Film Festival, and the Best Motion Picture in the Golden Globe? That is ridiculous. It is embarassing for producers associations which organize those festivals, and disrespetful for filmmakers from all the world. It is also a huge disappointment that Jacques Audiard, who made excellent Dheepan, A Prophet and Rust and Bone, is responsible for this. The film manager to make angry both Mexicans and transgender people due the stereotyped way it represented both. As I do not experience the movie from that place, I will criticize other extremely serious problems I found. First of all, the script and the whole story make no sense. Why the hell a drug trafficking boss who intends to undergo a sex reassignment surgery kidnaps an attorney and hire her to make it happen? Why the fact that had a transition to transgender contributed for a drug criminal like her to make an impacting campaign for finding missed cartel victims? That makes no sense, and is deffinitely not a serious way of dealing with neither of those important issues. Incoherences in script happen throughout the film, and I will not detail more of them in order to avoid spoiler. At least specifically in the last part of the movie those absurds could be viewed as a parody reference to Mexican soap operas. Additionally, dialogues are very bad , and so are all the songs and musical scenes . Kitsch visual does not work well in most of the film, and it looks like a B production despite the huge budget. In 2024, dosgusting Oppenheimer was awarded with the Oscar of the best film against excellent movies such as Zone of Interest and Anatomy of a Fall. Now , ridiculous Emília Perez has been awarded against much superior films such as I am still here and The Conclave. That is a shame!",4,8,2,0.0701904761904762,0.5776190476190476
,Disappointing and more,"I love Saldana, and I believe she did the best she could with her role in this film, at times deeply moving. So this is not an attack on the star. Nor is it criticism of the rest of the cast, the writer, director, etc. I was thrilled to hear the hype, read about the nominations, etc. So I settled down for a great time with this movie. And I was stunned and disappointed, not by the alleged brilliance of the production but by how deeply flawed the whole thing is. Others here have gone into extensive detail about the flaws treated as brilliance. In fact, they are not. No matter how many more great reviews and major awards, the film is a pretense of being something it is not. Just because writer, director, actors, etc attempt something complex and artistic in that complexity does not mean they succeeded: if the film does not work. It does not. And it is a disappointment because we believed the hype and wanted to believe this is a new masterpiece to love and watch again for all that complexity and experimentation. In fact-there is no greatness nor beauty but only the confused mess of people who wanted the experiment to be the art they were after. It isnt.",5,3,0,0.12949547558922558,0.5328861531986532
,Visually impressive but lacked depth,"The awards buzz brought me to this film and I was expecting something fun spirited and experimental. Emilia Perez however took itself very seriously and while the use of song was unconventional it was downbeat and unengaging, sapping the energy from the story.The story itself felt very simplistic for topics that are so current and complex. Although I cant draw from any personal experience I felt the transgender experience was far more deeply and thought provokingly conveyed in I saw the TV glow.The cinematography was impressive and the film looked great. There was a lot of darks and deep reds with an interesting, theatrical, spotlighting effect on many scenes.Overall, although nice to look at, I was not drawn in by the story or the characters both of which were a little too lacking in depth.",4,5,1,0.15645833333333334,0.5483333333333333

Dont get me wrong: the direction isnt dreadful as he can decently stage a dance sequence and create an atmosphere but happens occasionally. Like most people, most of my issues revolve around the horrible screenplay. It has a starting point with some potential but proceeds to fumble it with weak plotting and underwhelming personal dynamics between the characters. For a film called Emilia Pérez, it spends way too much time on Rita, who doesnt do anything interesting and the development of Jessi is messily written. Also, theres no reason for this to be a musical as the songs range from forgettable to straight-up bad. It has a tonal whiplash thats baffling. And that ending is a complete trainwreck and flop. The sad part is that - outside of Selena Gomez - the performances from the ladies are excellent, particularly Karla Sofía Gascón. Some of the best parts involved the titular character and Epifanía.

,Great and interesting musical,"I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 solely due to Selena Gomezs poor acting and her very bad Spanish. Throughout the movie, it bothered me that she couldnt speak the language at all, which made some scenes lose their authenticity.That said, Gascon Karla Sofía did an amazing job-I couldnt believe how well she played Manitas. Her performance was absolutely stunning and added so much depth to the film. Zoe Saldaña was brilliant as always; I love her in every movie, and this was no exception.I didnt know this was a musical-I went in blind, having only seen the movie mentioned at the Golden Globes-but it was definitely worth watching. The combination of the gritty life of the Mexican mob, the elegance of a ladys life, and the musical format was fresh and intriguing.More importantly, the film does an excellent job of raising awareness about gender dysphoria. Watching Emilia finally become herself and seeing how her life changed after embracing her true identity was both moving and thought-provoking. Overall, its a unique and compelling film that I would highly recommend, despite my issues with Gomezs role.",9,1,25,0.17222222222222225,0.5610493827160494
,"Emília Pérez: A Disastrous Attempt at Social Critique, Lost in Superficiality and Stereotypes","Emília Pérez is a cinematic disaster of epic proportions, filled with utterly misguided choices that overflow with superficiality and a lack of understanding of the themes it attempts to tackle. The film loses itself in its own fetishism, reducing Mexico and its social issues to a superficial and distorted vision marked by an outsiders perspective that fails to capture the complexity of a nation.The attempt to blend elements of magical realism with social critique turns into a disastrous parody, where violence and magic clash so awkwardly that the work becomes a tasteless joke. From the outset, the film proves incapable of addressing sensitive topics such as domestic violence, child abuse, female empowerment, or transsexuality with the seriousness and respect they deserve. Instead, the film sinks into shallow melodrama with no emotion, where generic catchphrases try to carry a weight that the direction and script cannot support.The performances are so stiff that its impossible to connect with the characters or their inner struggles, making them seem more like lifeless puppets than individuals seeking transformation. The use of saturated colors and dramatic lighting, which aims to create a contrast between light and shadow, turns out to be an empty attempt to give depth to a narrative that is, in fact, superficial and filled with clichés.In its obsession with pamphlet-style activism, the film divides the world into good and evil in such a simplistic way that it borders on childishness. The songs, which should be a highlight, fail miserably, with forced lyrics and melodies that are forgotten immediately after viewing, while the choreography is limited and unimaginative.Ultimately, Emília Pérez is a film that desperately tries to present itself as transgressive but instead creates a sense of secondhand embarrassment, with moments that generate awkward laughter rather than reflection. Its attempt to represent internal revolution as a solution to deep social issues is naive and ineffective. In the end, the film fails in its mission to explore human pain in an honest and meaningful way, delivering instead an empty spectacle that tries to sound profound without ever approaching what truly matters.",1,8,3,-0.0655388471177945,0.49256474519632404

,Lowering the Bar so Much That Anyone Can Step Over It,"Some films spark debate, and then theres Emilia Pérez-a movie that doesnt just divide opinions but leaves audiences wondering: How did this get nominated for anything? When a film reduces Mexico to a collection of lazy stereotypes, handles delicate topics with the depth of a puddle, and sells itself as groundbreaking when its really just a directionless mess, you start to question the state of cinema.The real problem isnt just that Emilia Pérez is bad-because it is-but what its recognition says about this years films. If this is one of the best movies of the year, then there was nothing better. And thats depressing. It sets the bar so low that being nominated alongside it feels like an insult, dragging down everything else in the process.The so-called bold mix of thriller and musical quickly crumbles under a script that lacks coherence and performances that do nothing to elevate the material. And with a director mistaking kitsch for art, whats left is a film that doesnt deserve awards-it deserves to be a cautionary tale.

,winner of Best Ensemble Cast at Cannes,"It looks like trans is becoming a favorite subject for screenwriters. It serves as a subtle plot device in a movie I recently saw. Obviously, it would be a spoiler for me to name that movie. Emilia Perez, on the other hand, is all about trans, as you will find out just 15 minutes into this two-hour-plus movie which is mostly in Spanish.The start of the movie is a bit of a red herring, when you are introduced to Mexico City shady lawyer Rita who just won another murder case. You would think that it is a genre crime thriller. It is, but that is not the key element. Dancing and singing a lot , she breaks the fourth wall and intimates directly to the audience that her life is getting nowhere, despite being a professional with a reasonably successful business. Then comes the main story.Half-kidnapped-style , she is brought to drug dealing kingpin Manitas who is fed up with two years attempt of changing into a woman, without much success. I am a lawyer, not a doctor, Ritas obvious response. But it makes sense that Manitas wants to hire a capable person, regardless of profession, who has been a good fixer, to find him a good doctor, as well as take care of all other necessary business if the operation is successful. Manitas wants to vanish complete from this earth and carry on in a new life, as a woman.But there are complications. Manitas has a lovely wife Jessi he obviously loves, and two small kids that he loves even more. It is with much poignancy that Rita completes her mission, finding a doctor that successfully operates on Manitas, as well we settling he family into a plush residence in Switzerland, making them believe that their beloved husband and father has died. While Rita pays a price emotionally, albeit just as an outsider observing the breakup of this wonderful family, she is richly rewarded financially.Fast forward 4 years, London, in a glamorous social function, Rita comes across an apparently very wealthy woman Emilia Perez who also came originally from Mexico. It doesnt take long for Emilia to reveal herself , as the altered ego of Manitas.I wouldnt go too much into the remainder of the plot. However, the plot driver can be easily summed up as: Manita still loves the kids and cannot bear to live a life without them. With a little imagination, an audience can see the melodrama this can lead to. The question is just how much? The answer is: a lot.The storytelling is intriguing without being convoluting. The cinematography is at times dreamy, elevating the drama to something higher, best exemplified by the bonfire scene with Manitas and his loved once lying cozily, close together on the beach, star gazing, feeling content and happy. The poignancy is particularly palpable to the audience, who know that he will soon vanish from their life.Emilia Perez won Best Ensemble Cast at Cannes with aforementioned Saldana, Gascon and Gomez, plus a fourth Adriana Paz who plays Emilia Perezs lover.",,1,26,0.24083725182863114,0.501658829676071

The improbably, easy transformation of the main character from brutal cartel overlord to beneficent champion, who sets about reuniting and uncovering all the lost souls that disappear amidst the cartel wars and gang violence experienced in parts of Mexico.Does it feel like a Mexican movie? No. Its an enchanted tale of a person who longed to put behind the life they had live so far and emerged on the other side of a horrific surgical journey to become a person that they had only imagined.The mixing in of musical numbers amidst the drama only adds to it.

,AI fraud and then some,"Heres an article draft focusing on critical aspects of Emilia Perez that have been discussed: Emilia Perez: A Transgender Story Gone Wrong Emilia Perez aims to tackle the complex topic of transgender identity, but ultimately falls short due to several critical flaws: * Stereotypical Depiction: The film relies on harmful stereotypes about transgender individuals, portraying Emilias transition as solely focused on physical changes rather than exploring the deeper emotional and psychological aspects.* Lack of Authenticity: The films portrayal of transgender experiences rings false, lacking nuance and feeling inauthentic. This is further compounded by the casting of a cisgender actress in the lead role.* Regressive View of Gender: Emilia Perez perpetuates a binary view of gender, suggesting that medical transition is the only path to true gender identity. This ignores the diverse experiences of transgender individuals and disregards non-binary identities.* Sensationalism: The film sensationalizes transgender issues, focusing on the most shocking elements rather than offering a thoughtful and nuanced exploration of the topic.While Emilia Perez may have good intentions, its problematic approach ultimately undermines its message and reinforces harmful stereotypes about transgender people.",1,6,2,-0.039772727272727286,0.5826298701298701

I guess this movie has other issues other than that but come on, the line between ridiculous and fine is really thin in musicals, while in a film like Wicked I can get my head around the fact that I am seeing a bunch of people spontaneously singing during a normal conversation, a story involving violence and Mexican cartels its just borderline absurd!I do feel this was a missed opportunity, I applaud the fact that it is a Spanish speaking film, I like this trend of Hollywood giving spotlight to non-English movies, I applaud the acting of both Zoe and Karla and I applaud the representation, telling a story of a trans person being depicted by a trans actor without the movie being preachy about it.However the execution was completely messed up!Taking aside that this is a musical where cartel violence, murder and kidnapping are the center piece, why would they have us try to empathize with someone thats a cartel leader, who has done some of the worse atrocities most likely that a human can do, yet we should just simply forget and accept her new life?I saw some reviews coming from Mexican people being offended about the cartel depiction and use of stereotypes, I dont blame them, they couldve done a similar story in a completely different set and why not hire more Mexican actors for the main parts? I am not saying that it should be a full Mexican cast but Selena barely speaks Spanish, I am Portuguese but I can clearly hear the accent and its completely broken, not close to any kind of native Spanish..Plus some characters story lines are dubious, why does Zoes character keeps being around Emilia after her mission was done?

It feels forced.I am not confident for the Oscars this year in terms of the kinds of stories in the nominated movies, I hope to be wrong but its not a good start..",5,5,2,0.01924242424242424,0.40862554112554117
,Who is this movie for?,"The music and dancing are very good. I dont speak Spanish, which means I didnt notice anything wrong with the Spanish dialogue written by French artists. I think the performances by both Gomez and Saldaña were very strong, but Gascóns character is despicable. I dont think most people have the ability to maintain an empathetic connection with a trans character who beats their wife post-transition when they dont get their way.There is a lot of very artistic scenes in this movie, and I love a lot of the expressionism and emotion here. But on the whole, this movie is not self aware at all. It fails to seriously ground itself enough to have an emotional impact beyond disappointment.That said, I expect better work from everyone involved in the future. This has potential, and so do the people involved.",1,5,2,0.14018518518518516,0.5069444444444444
,An Ambitious but Flawed Musical Crime Drama,"French director Jacques Audiards Emilia Pérez attempts to blend crime, drama, and musical spectacle in an unconventional way, following the journey of a cartel leader who reinvents herself as a humanitarian. While the film presents an intriguing premise, its execution raises several narrative and thematic issues that undermine its credibility.At the center of the story is Juan Manitas Del Monte , a notorious cartel boss who orchestrates an elaborate scheme to fake his own death, transition into her true identity as Emilia Pérez, and dedicate herself to helping families uncover the fate of their loved ones lost to cartel violence. The film leans heavily into the theme of self-discovery, reinforcing the idea that embracing ones true self leads to personal redemption. However, the idea that such a ruthless figure could suddenly become a force for good through self-actualization is a significant leap, making the transformation feel overly idealized rather than grounded in real-world complexity.To the films credit, Emilia is not portrayed as entirely flawless. Her past resurfaces in a key moment of moral conflict when her children are taken from her, triggering a darker response. However, some plot developments strain plausibility-such as Gustavos retaliation against Emilia despite having been threatened and paid to leave the country. His ability to carry out an elaborate kidnapping despite these factors seems unlikely. Additionally, questions arise regarding Emilias continued influence over the prison system after her supposed death, particularly in her efforts to aid families seeking closure regarding cartel-related disappearances.The film draws inspiration from real-life organizations that work to uncover the fate of missing persons, yet it provides little exploration of the risks involved in challenging such powerful forces. While finding out where a loved one was killed or buried may offer some solace, the film does not engage deeply with the emotional complexities surrounding this aspect of justice.As a musical, Emilia Pérez features stylistic choices reminiscent of early MTV music videos. While visually dynamic, the musical sequences at times feel disconnected from the gravity of the subject matter. A particular standout moment is the upbeat portrayal of gender-affirming surgery, which, while celebratory, does not acknowledge the complexity of such procedures or the range of experiences individuals face.Performance-wise, Karla Sofía Gascón delivers a strong, charismatic lead portrayal, making Emilia a compelling presence even when the script falters. Zoe Saldaña, playing the lawyer who facilitates Emilias transformation, delivers a solid performance, though her characters development feels somewhat limited. Meanwhile, Selena Gomez, despite her talent, struggles with her Spanish-language delivery, making her role feel less natural compared to the rest of the cast.The films release has been accompanied by real-world controversy surrounding its lead actress, adding an unexpected layer of discourse. Gascóns past social media remarks have sparked debate, leading to discussions about whether her statements conflict with the films themes of inclusivity and transformation. While she has apologized, the controversy has overshadowed some of the films reception, reflecting ongoing tensions in the entertainment industry.Ultimately, Emilia Pérez is a film with grand ambitions, blending crime drama with musical storytelling in a visually striking way. However, its idealized view of redemption, uneven narrative logic, and selective engagement with its themes prevent it from achieving the depth it aims for. While it provides moments of strong performances and striking visuals, the film struggles to fully reconcile its ambitious premise with a more nuanced exploration of its subject matter.",4,7,4,0.1158635676492819,0.4955215419501134
,Misogyny: The musical.,"Had this been a campy slocky musical like Rocky Horror this could have worked. None of the characters are likable but the film would have been fun and had some cracking numbers. But it isnt.Had this been a study into the psyche of a man who tries to escape his past by changing his whole appearance and life. But thinks he can reintegrate himself back into the society he ruined, but comes to the realisation that he was a monster and tries to make amends. But it isnt.What we get is a film with very jarring musical numbers that dont advance the plot or come from an overly emotional stance, but just happen. There is no thread that links the songs together, no recurring motifs, no specific themes for certain characters. Just randomly placed, horribly paced, and terribly repetitive lines.The acting isnt bad, but the characters are horrible and the women are portrayed in a very misogynistic light. All of them are either dumb, easily manipulated, or both. Im sorry but how did Rita know who Emilia was within seconds and yet Jessi had no idea until the end when he confessed to her who they really were.There are no clear motives as to why or how people are identified as being the right sort of person to do the job. Its just oh you you will do, will you do this for me, thats great thank youEmilia is a narcissist and psychopath enjoying the adulation she gets from those around, whilst knowing full well what he was and what he did in the past.Rita is not smart as she blindly accepts and does what she is told to be...why... money! How shallow must you be to do that, knowing you are letting a man get away with murder... oh yes a woman who helps a man get away with murder at the very start.Jessi is kinda pointless and helpless, and is the reason why Emilia dies at the end.The love interest must be very naive if she couldnt spot those large shoulders, implants, dense bones, and large hands and feet would not have belonged to a woman. I dont care if she saw past that and found love, but please dont insult our intelligence. Same goes for the men who would have had to pick Emilia up to kidnap her. You telling me these guys wouldnt have gone hang on how heavy is Emilia?!?This film has to be a troll - it really does as there is no way this could have been made in good faith and conscience. The plot is I want you to help me change - everyone else oh ok, I want my family back -everyone else oh, ok, I want to be loved, adored, and worshiped for all the good Im doing - everyone else oh, ok.Also there are almost three minutes of Production Company credits at the start - a film with no real sfx, or big stage/scenery requirements needs 6 different companies. Clearly no one had much faith in the film but felt they should give something to make sure they meet creditor criteria.No this film does not deserve its 13 nominations, unless they are for the Razzies!I thought the Paris 2024 open ceremony was terrible, now I just think the French really hate us.",1,10,7,0.02135714285714287,0.46965608465608466

,A Promising Plot Falls Flat in Execution,"Emilia Perez had all the makings of an intriguing story, but it ultimately fell short of its potential. The plot itself was promising, exploring complex themes and a unique narrative. However, the decision to present this story as a musical film somewhat undermined its seriousness, making it difficult to fully engage with the characters and their struggles.One of the major issues was the portrayal of Emilia. The character didnt align with her past, making her transformation seem less about the journey of a transgender individual and more like an entirely different person. This disconnect made it difficult to connect with and understand her on a deeper level.While the musical elements brought some moments of entertainment, they often felt out of place in a story that required a more grounded and nuanced approach. The result was a film that never quite found its footing and failed to hook me until the end.",5,5,3,-0.013958333333333333,0.48583333333333334
,cavalier dismissal of meaningful storytelling,"I decided to watch Emilia Pérez purely based on its critical acclaim and the buzz surrounding its Oscar nominations. Typically, I steer clear of films that glorify drug cartels and trafficking, as I find the subject matter inherently problematic. However, I gave this one a chance.Initially, I found it watchable. The film is undeniably well-crafted, with believable characters, and Selena Gomez delivers a bewildering yet compelling performance. From a technical standpoint, its hard to fault the movie.But as I reflected on it after watching, my feelings shifted dramatically. I find myself increasingly appalled by Emilia Pérez. It reeks of pretentiousness and lacks empathy entirely. It doesnt aim to make you feel or understand-its designed purely to dazzle critics.If I compare it to the soft sensitivity of Lucas Quaraninos Queer, which deeply resonated with me, Emilia Pérez feels like a hollow circus. While Queer treats its subject matter with respect and humanity, Emilia Pérez flaunts a blatant disregard for human values. It critiques the very things it indulges in, making the film feel hypocritical and self-serving.The argument that this represents freedom falls flat for me. This isnt freedom-its a cavalier dismissal of everything that makes storytelling meaningful. For me, this film is a demonstration of excess without substance.

,This movie is a complete time waste,"Jacques Audiards Emilia Pérez attempts to merge musical elements with crime drama and themes of identity, but unfortunately fails to live up to its ambitious premise. The film ends up being a dull and meaningless experience that offers nothing new, neither as a piece of art nor as entertainment.The Musical Aspect: An Unnecessary BurdenThe musical sequences, seemingly intended to lighten emotional tension or enhance character depth, feel unnecessary and, at times, awkward. They often disrupt the narrative flow and add a sense of theatricality that detracts from the films more serious themes.Weak Plot DevelopmentThe storyline unfolds in a slow and convoluted manner. The conflicts and interactions between characters feel superficial, leaving the central themes and messages underdeveloped and incomplete. The characters motivations are poorly explained, making it hard to connect with or care about them.Lack of SubstanceThe film lacks the artistic or emotional depth one might expect from such a format. Despite the variety of themes it attempts to tackle, Emilia Pérez ultimately leaves the audience with nothing of value-no lasting questions, no new emotions, no meaningful impact.Final ThoughtsEmilia Pérez had the potential to be a compelling and thought-provoking story, but instead, it ends up being a waste of time. If youre looking for a film that delivers emotions or artistic depth, this one is likely to disappoint.",5,5,4,-0.06198347107438017,0.5429522497704315
,"Definitely a style over substance movie, but it is VERY stylish.","I think theres something to be said about the audacity of a movie like Emilia Perez; it follows a Mexican lawyer, Rita whos retained by a cartel boss to arrange for a...sex change, wherein he becomes the titular Emilia Perez . Oh, and its a musical. Like a very, very in your face musical.I think this movie is a lot of fun for the most part, and driven by some truly fantastic performances. It has an over dramatic, telenovela style to it thats kind of irresistible. The musical numbers are fun, catchy, innovative, and extremely well choreographed.Yet, I was taken aback by how poorly the film explores the tensions at the heart of it. Emilia, as we know, was once a man. She had a family, with a wife and kids . This tension is at the heart of the movie, but its never really explored in a satisfying way. Nor is her relationship with a woman whose own her husband she ordered the killing of explored much either, in a thematic sense.What annoyed me the most about this movie was how it absconds the negative aspects of Emilias life choices, because, Ill come out and say it, shes trans. She suffers consequences, but is ultimately revered and praised throughout the movie.I also didnt really love the central relationship between Perez and Rita, like I could buy that theyd become friends, but not that Rita would be so devoted to Emilia. There are also a lot of thematic subplots about Mexicos ongoing, brutal drug war, that I wished the film pursued more.So, overall, I think Emilia Perez is a fun time, but not much more than that. Its a lot of spectacle, with less substance than I wanted.",4,10,14,0.04272727272727273,0.4789898989898989
,Not an Oscar Winner,"While it is an interesting departure from the norm, combining a musical with a crime drama as well as a transgender cartel leader, I cannot say that this film deserves the accolades it has received. The story itself is patently ridiculous and episodic. Zoe Saldana acting is decent, but the rest of the acting is sub-par. Gascons performance as the cartel leader is not worthy of the critical acclaim she has received, and I was very disappointed with Selana Gomezs performance as the wife of the leader - it is wooden and uninteresting. Therefore, I cannot recommend this film, and I certainly hope it does not win any awards. 5/10.",5,3,2,-0.08283730158730158,0.4927579365079365
,Had to see what won over Wicked (and everything else),"Ill start with the positives: the storyline is good. I think that in different hands this could have been a fantastic movie that calls attention to missing and murdered individuals and tells a beautiful tale of someone becoming their best self and trying to correct the sins of their past.Unfortunately, it was not in such hands. The dialogue was terrible, the songs were laughable, and the singing was mid at best, horrendous at worst. The actors all did a wonderful job with the material they were given, but I really dont know how any of them were able to keep a straight face. The dialogue issue could be attributed to the amount of translation being done here. I watched it as a movie written in French, translated to Spanish, and then subbed in English. Thats a lot of translating, which may have impacted the dialogue as perceived by me. It was also a musical for absolutely no reason so far as I can tell. Which I suppose could be said of all musicals, but this would have been far more effective as a drama.I give it a 5 because the acting was good, the story was good, but the writing and singing were terrible. I also took issue with the fact that Emilia was misgendered throughout the entire first act. Once we find out who she is, she shouldnt have to undergo surgical procedures before being referred to using her correct pronouns. Definitely not deserving of the awards its received. Not even close to the best musical of the past year, and definitely not the best movie overall.",5,4,4,0.16000000000000003,0.5208333333333334
,The blunder of 2024,"Road to the Oscars 2025. This movie is nominated in 12 categories with 13 overall nominations.Emilia Perez is an incompetently made movie. If you remove the political aspects and where you stand on them this is just a incompetently done movie no matter the perspective. This movie was just bad, not a lot else to add to that statement. It is a movie that wants to do a lot of thongs but don´t want to do them at the same time. This was the atrocity nomination from the academy, there is at least once a year and to see that it is nominated this many times is baffling because let me be honest. Half of them it should not be nominated in and you could easily have found another movie to compete in that category. Seriously if this movie had been so bad it´s good I would have liked it more, but this is only that for a few minutes and then it´s just boring.The lawyer Rita helps the cartel lord Manitas to change gender. After the operation, Manitas, now Emilia needs more favours from Rita.Don´t let the description draw you in as of you are getting a gangster movie, you are not. You are getting 2 hours of pointless drama that has no stakes. This is a plot that wants to do a lot of things, but gives the characters no motivation to do so. Characters are butchered here, they have no motivation until they need it. The plot is just happening when it needs to, the political commentaries are just hanging in the air without being talked about really. This is not a bold or competently told movie, it´s boring, incoherent and says nothing. It wants to talk about cartels and changing gender without actually talking about it and even misrepresenting a lot of the culture it wants to show. It is a movie that fails everyone watching it.This movie is also tonally confused. Does it want to be a comedy or serious drama? The tone shifts a lot and I have no idea who made it change that many times, this might be some sort of studio interference but this movie is all over the place.While the acting is mixed here it doesnt really matter since the characters are so poorly written. The character Jessi has a terrible accent and it shows when they are next to other Spanish speakers, but they did ad a few lines that try to explain why they speak different accents of Spanish half the time. Karla Sofia Gascon gives a great performance as Emilia, also being brave to show a male presenting version of the character, but the character infuriates me. It is a character that wants everything and didnt think everything through and acts like a spoiled brat when something doesnt really go their way. It is a character we are supposed to have sympathy with, and forget their past as if gender is some sort of Jekyll and Hyde situation where Emilia has nothing to do with their former self, this is just an annoying character. Zoe Saldana is no doubt the best performance here, giving her all in the music numbers and the drama, once again the character she plays is nonsensical as she has no real goal, just being sad all the time for no reason until the end where her real motivation all of a sudden kicks in. It´s an embarrassing show of characters.This is a musical and half the songs suck. You have probably already heard the now infamous one about the plastic operation, but it´s not just that one. The lyrics are very dull and dumb half the time especially in the first half of the movie. This is also topped with the most obvious pitch correction I have heard in a while. There are so many manipulated voices here and it´s obvious to hear. I have nothing against pitch correction, it´s like editing, but don´t make it obvious to us, top this with terrible choreography that is filmed poorly and you take all the magic out of a musical. There are a few songs that are actually good El mal, Para and as much as it is a weird song papa are all good and well performed. My thoughts on Mi camino is that it is a generic love pop song. The score is this synth music that just don´t speak to me. I guess it´s not bad but again not for me.The cinematography is too tight here. There are a few wide shots, but mostly we are in these tight closed frames even at times where it looks unintentional and actually hurting the visual showing of the movie. So many of the dance choreographies are butchered by this tight frame, hiding it, top this with blurring a lot of the backgrounds and you just have such an ugly movie.There is this Sabrina Gomez song where it goes from a bedroom to a dark void and I did not understand the vision here. It is jarring and the movie has so many of these moments where it forgets its a musical half the time to then come back to it and you just sitting there with tonal whiplash. It´s just a boring Baz Luhrmann movie.There is some ugly fades in this movie where it just goes black and it all of a sudden does it a few times in a row.This movie is not political no matter who tells you otherwise. It´s brave to talk about these things but to cowards to actually comment on anything because then you actually are provoking someone. It is just a passive mess that has no idea what it wants at all.I guess the makeup and hairstyling is good when you think about Karla Gascon had to wear male presenting makeup and hair plus the movie looks good in that department.While there are things to like about Emilia Perez it is first and foremost a trainwreck. It is a huge mess of a movie that is incompetent in its storytelling and presentation. While it might have had good intentions it butchers it´s goodwill very fast, becoming a huge messOscar predictions: Okay lets run through these and there is a lot to get through. If Emilia Perez wins best picture, it would be another Crash win. The academy virtue signalling that they support the courses this movie barley talk about and handles in poor ways. I have only watched 3 of the contenders and out of the 3 I want Dune 2 to win. I have heard that the biggest chances is this though and movies like The Brutalist and Anora. While I liked Karla Gascons performance I don´t know if it deserves an Oscar for best actress, I feel like she did a good job and was bold to go male presenting, but I was not wowed. The only other performance I saw was Cynthia Erivo and she did good too, making a performance that moved me more. I have heard Demi Moore should have a good chance too. Zoe Saldana as best supporting actress is a good choice. She really shows the most versatility in this movie and gives a good performance. Once again the only other performance I can compare it to is Ariana Grande and she did well too. I don´t want this movie to win directing, I feel like the directing is overall boring and bad there must be something better. Same with adapted screenplay , it is a big mess that says nothing. I find the cinematography either bad or uninspiring, would rather have Dune 2 or Nosferatu winning. I don´t know if I noticed the editing to be exceptional but found the many fades funny. I can only compared it to Wicked and again I don´t know if I found the editing significant, there must be something better. Wow all the movies about music is nominated for sound! Give it to Dune please. I understand the makeup and hairstyling nom, but it´s up against the Substance, Wicked and Nosferatu, all movies I would rather see win. I hate the score for this movie there must be something better. Haven´t heard the other original songs, but Mi Camino is a generic pop song and El Mal actually has a bigger chance to win, but Elton John is here so. I don´t want this movie to win international feature, but it´s going to because it is also nominated for best picture, an annoying trend the last couple of years. Okay that was a lot! But overall I want this movie to take home like 1 Oscar maybe 2 awards and that´s it. Out of 13 nominations that is a bit insane. There is always an Oscar blunder movie and this is no doubt this years.",3,2,1,0.09329813108038912,0.4540527393753202
,Worst movie I've ever seen,"No words. Jack and Jill is a ten next to this, Zoe did a good job and thats the only thing I can rescue, the whole cast and even the director are a mess.Emilia Pérez tries to be a groundbreaking fusion of crime thriller and musical spectacle but ends up a tonal disaster. While its premise is bold and the performances are commendable, the execution is a mess. The musical numbers feel forced, disrupting any tension the story attempts to build, and the film drowns in its own pretensions, mistaking heavy-handed messaging for depth. Visually striking yet narratively incoherent, its an overindulgent experiment that collapses under the weight of its ambitions.And its a loss for cinema and for the Oscars and their credibility.If I could put 0.1 stars for this I would.

,A Film With Lots To Discuss,"Theres no doubt a lot that can be examined and discussed with this film. For me it was incredibly difficult to rate because there are features of it that I found unique and very compelling while other aspects were just so over the top and damaging that I couldnt decide on how to weight it all. Therefore I put it as a passing score as something that is worth a watch if not only to see and assess for yourself what is no doubt an incredibly unique piece of cinema.First of all, the most compelling aspect of the film is the characters struggles with personal decision making. Every decision the characters make there is an overwhelming impact on those around them. This movie as well as any Ive seen shows these impacts extremely well. The actors do an incredible job expressing the emotions associated with the impact it has on their characters lives. The cast itself feels very cohesive in telling this story.Im still undecided on whether or not the musical aspect of it is necessary. There are some parts it helps emphasize the emotional struggle and some where it just feels way too excessive and potentially crossing a line for other reasons mentioned below.The major downside for me about this film , and one that is clearly a massively huge problem for many others as well , is presenting this entire story within the context of Mexican drug cartels. If the emotions of the characters feel so real the story itself feels just the opposite. Nobody ever questions where Emilias funds come from for the charity, the motivations, how to find all the mass burial sites, access to information, etc.In many ways the story downplays a huge humanitarian crisis in Mexico. At the end of the day, despite the challenges faced , Emilia was previously a major cartel kingpin and murderous criminal responsible for thousands of lives lost.In that sense the film didnt bother to really examine this reality nearly enough in my view. There was one small scene where a mother presents a pamphlet about her lost son where Emilia shows a sense of remorse, but this needed to be expanded on. Further, the fact that Rita the lawyer was so disturbed at the start of the film about defending and helping someone get off for murder who she knew was guilty and yet did not in many ways struggle at all to continue freely working alongside Emilia who was responsible for mass atrocities to me was discomforting and conflicting.In the way that it only presented Emilia as a victim was troubling and problematic. I dont have a problem with someone recognizing their past mistakes and doing what they can to change and try to make up for that past as best they can. However, the film chooses to gloss over the recognition of those past decisions much too quickly. In this way I found it quite disrespectful of the very real problem of drug cartel violence and the hundreds of thousands of lives its cost in present day Mexico. In reading others critiques, I strongly agree on this aspect.In summary, I thought the characters were interesting. Some of the acting I found incredible, particularly Zoe Saldana. Her range for acting is astounding. Not many can go from Guardians of the Galaxy to this style of film and pull off both so exceptionally well. However, as clearly stated above , the film has some huge pitfalls and I wonder how this will impact its fate at the Oscars.",5,2,2,0.1615079365079365,0.5427777777777778

,"Good subject and acting ,but Bad Movie , Bad Execution","Emilia Pérez is a 2024 Spanish language French musical crime comedy film written and directed by Jacques Audiard. The French production is based on Audiards opera libretto of the same name, which was in turn loosely adapted from Boris Razons 2018 novel Écoute. The film stars Zoe Saldaña, Karla Sofía Gascón, Selena Gomez, Adriana Paz, Mark Ivanir, and Édgar Ramírez.It is musical drama featuring a cartel leaders journey of gender transformation. The story follows Emilia, who enlists lawyer Rita to fake her death and navigate her transition, leading to unexpected emotional encounters and a nonprofit initiative to aid families affected by cartel violence.Movie is packed with powerful performances, particularly from Karla Sofía Gascón as Emilia, earning her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Leading Actress. Zoe Saldaña brings pause to her role as Emilias lawyer, she was ambitious but not careless showcasing a blend of strength and vulnerability towards herself and her work. She won golden globe for this.Audiards direction is ambitious yet polarizing, blending operatic elements with a chaotic narrative structure.Overall Emilia Pérez addresses themes of identity and gender through its central characters transformative journey. The movie explores embracing true self, challenging traditional gender norms.Great subjects and story but poor execution if it was just a drama movie not musical it could had done better.",5,3,8,0.1315897435897436,0.47310256410256407
,Feels silly trying to embrace this misbegotten musical,"A veteran criminal defense attorney in Mexico is enlisted by a notorious drug lord, who plans to escape both the authorities and his criminal rivals, by having a sex change operation and reinventing his life. This very unusual premise might have yielded better results if handled differently. But where this film goes wrong, I dont know where to begin.Zoe Saldana does her best with the woefully executed material. Selena Gomez, who years ago, showed promise as an actress doesnt really gel in this role. Karla Sofia Gascon is certainly good but her performance struck me as one-dimensional. Needless to say, this film wont be remembered for its acting.This films subject matter is actually and what could have been a very powerful conclusion winds up getting its pitch queered by the films ridiculous musical genre. Its mystifying how this ended up a musical. Its almost impossible to take seriously as such. Some viewers will be more open-minded, but a film that gets much acclaim should not seem so cheap and... Im very sorry, but.. trashy. Not recommended.",3,2,1,0.038888888888888896,0.5513888888888888
,Should not work on ANY level - yet has enough standout scenes to match its massive failings,"First and foremost, this is a French film about Mexico - but not actually IN it. While filming a work where location fits better with the creators capabilities is nothing new Emilia Perez is in on another level for disregarding the input of the countrys people so thoroughly that all of its songs were written in French and then machine-translated into Spanish, leading to justified opprobium from the entire Latin America.Likewise, though Karla Sofia Gascon actually is trans, none of the writers were and the internet isnt short on takes on why its a problem. Ill just say the depiction fell flat for me - and it didnt help that not only the film never convincingly reckons with the characters crimes but the way the operation was supposedly kept secret was full of holes.In general, the entire Manitas cartel is a cardboard prop to the point the film does not even to bother to establish who took over after Emilia disappeared under that formal identity. Saldanas Rita changes her mind so often on whether or not its acceptable to benefit from the proceedings of crime, she comes across like a weathervane. It doesnt help that the main plot relies on the contrivance I saw in too many others - the assumption you could drop characters separately from each other, skip years ahead, and then barely anything would change and they would fail to form new connections in spite of having every reason to. And what serves as the climatic conclusion here is one of the most ludicrous endings of the year.And yet, and yet and YET.... I would be lying if I didnt say this kept me engaged throughout. First, second and third, Zoe Saldana is a veritable force of nature in this role and the sheer energy she brings to every musical performance is hard to describe in words. Further, the cinematography of every one of those numbers is INCREDIBLY strong, at times reminiscent of the best of Indian cinema musical numbers such as the incredibly complex combinations of hundred or so scenes in Premalus songs. In particular, the haunting shot at the conclusion of Para beats any other scene in any other Best Picture nominee this year hands down. And while I found the handling of the timeskip poor, the film still has, on the whole, a substantially better-defined cast than nearly everything it is competing against.Hence, Emilia Perez is deeply flawed film - but in my view, so is practically everything the Academy chose to put up against it this year, in spite of many better alternatives being present. I.e. Whether you are Mexican, LGBTQ or anyone else, it is massively hypocritical to say this film romanticizes cartels yet turn around and praise Anora when Anora the character sees nothing wrong with taking advantage of equivalent scumbags wealth and the script never depicts that as a failing. Same when one attacks this film for, say, referring to something like a jury yet gives a pass to Conclaves Cardinals being ignorant of the basics of their faith. The Brutalist takes an important real-life architect who had been established in the U. S. for many years and replaces him with a caricature of a newly arrived immigrant while trivializing heroin abuse. Dune: Part 2 greatly dumbs down the book, turning the Harkonnens from corrupt, depraved yet scarily intelligent indictments of Roman-style nobility into pale Sith rip-offs who understand nothing but violence. The Substance cant decide whether its protagonist is an experienced talent who led a popular show for many years or a naive airhead who cannot count, is still surprised at 50 years of age that young guys are shallow and would rather stick newspapers to a massive window in her penthouse instead of buying curtains. And A Complete Unknown has so little to say and so inferior to Better Man or Kneecap or even Piece by Piece that spotlighting it is practically inexplicable to me.In all, Im cautiously waiting to see Nickel Boys and Im Still Here to give me something to affirmatively root for, not just stick with the best of the flawed options as is currently the case for me and Wicked.",5,2,5,0.0880268308080808,0.48380934343434323
,Tone-deaf in more than one sense.,"I was stunned after watching Emilia Perez, but mostly for the wrong reasons.I wont deny the movie tries to be innovative and it is very entertaining... You are continuosly slaped by so much nonsense that it never gets boring. Besides I loved the job of Karla Sofía Gascón, her take on Emilia is really good.However, and specially as a mexican, for me the movie is extremely tone-deaf, plainly unsensitive and the redemption arch just not believable.The handling of the missing persons topic is plainly disrespectful to victims and their families, re-victimized in this mockery.The lyrics... Painful to hear as a Spanish speaker . It woukd have been much better to have them in English or French, than hear them and feel the lyricist used Google translate.I wont even talk about the forced inclusion of Selena Gomez and Zoe Saldañas characters origin to justify their accents... Specially with Jessi, let her sing and speak in English! Hearing her in Spanish was really cringeworthy.And Im not an expert... But im not sure if the whole transition plot was ok for thevtrans community.All in all, it was a surprising and very disaponting experience, and I really really wanted to like Emilia.",5,1,6,0.06678571428571428,0.42782010582010577
,A wild entertaining ride that overwhelms itself.,"It mixes so many ideas, themes and genres into one that its hard to define. Some of it works and some of it does not.The first half is pretty good, setting up several intriguing arcs. The second half however feels much more muddled. Characters have missing motivations leading to a climax that feels strangely forced and did not hit me emotionally the way it probably should have.The cast was great lead by Gascon and Zoe as the leads, who both give strong emotional performances.Some songs were genuinely enjoyable with great visuals to compliment them, but others were easily forgettable.This film simply does not know what it wants to be. Its campy but theres no humor. Its serious and then breaks into song. Its messy but I would be lying if I didnt admit I enjoyed some of it and wanted to see where it was going.",5,2,20,0.18033333333333335,0.46595238095238095
,Standout,"Emilia Perez is a standout film that exceeded my expectations with the impressive performances of Zoe Saldaña, Karla Sofia, and Selena Gomez. They form a captivating trio that delivers raw emotion and depth. This unique film offers a thrilling experience, with everything coming together beautifully. Saldañas nuanced portrayal captures her characters intensity, while Sofia adds an authentic vulnerability that draws you in. Gomez surprises with her strength and great chemistry with the other actors. Their performances enhance the storyline, creating memorable moments throughout. Would definitely recommend.",,1,26,0.3766025641025641,0.7363782051282052
